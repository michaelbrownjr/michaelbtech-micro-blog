			 <p>Okay, so you know how dolphins make all those cool clicking and whistling sounds? Turns out, it&rsquo;s super complex, like their own secret language. Scientists have been trying to crack the code for ages, but it&rsquo;s tough because the ocean is noisy, and dolphin chatter is complicated. <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/dolphingemma/">Enter Google AI with something called DolphinGemma</a>. It&rsquo;s basically a smart AI model they&rsquo;ve built specifically to listen in and try to understand what dolphins might be saying.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T8GdEVVvXyE" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>So, how does it actually work? Instead of scientists needing tons of custom, expensive gear, the article mentions they actually used Google Pixel smartphones as part of the setup! This is pretty clever because using phones makes the whole system easier to maintain, uses less power, and shrinks the cost and size – huge wins when you&rsquo;re doing research out in the middle of the ocean. Then, the DolphinGemma AI does the heavy lifting on the sound analysis. Think of it like giving the AI a massive playlist of dolphin sounds recorded underwater. The AI listens to everything – all the clicks, whistles, and background noise. It uses clever machine learning tricks (based on Google&rsquo;s Gemma AI tech) to start picking out patterns all by itself. It learns to spot the difference between random ocean noise and actual dolphin calls, and even starts figuring out which sounds might be important.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/uploads/2025/chat-pixel.width-1000.format-webp.webp" alt="Auto-generated description: A smartphone is placed inside an electronic enclosure with various connectors and a coiled wire."></p>
<p>The really neat part is that DolphinGemma learns directly from the raw sound waves. It doesn&rsquo;t need humans to tell it &ldquo;this is a whistle&rdquo; or &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a click&rdquo; beforehand. It just listens and learns, kind of like how a baby learns language by hearing it all the time. This means it might catch subtle things in their calls that humans could easily miss. The goal is to get good enough to identify different types of calls and maybe even tell individual dolphins apart just by their voice! The AI&rsquo;s predictive power can also help researchers react faster during interactions, making the study more fluid.</p>
<p>Beyond just dolphins, think about where else this kind of smart listening tech could be useful. The basic idea of teaching AI to pick out meaningful patterns in complex sounds could definitely be applied elsewhere in nature. Imagine, for instance, using something similar to better understand all the different animal sounds happening in a busy rainforest environment. It might help track hard-to-see animal populations or get a better sense of the ecosystem&rsquo;s health just by listening in.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/uploads/2025/dolphins.width-1000.format-webp.webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, are we going to have full conversations with Flipper tomorrow? Probably not! Getting a complete &ldquo;dolphin dictionary&rdquo; is still way off. But, this DolphinGemma thing is a huge step. Understanding dolphins better could tell us so much about how they live, hang out, and how they&rsquo;re doing in the ocean. Plus, the tech they built for this could help us understand other chatty animals too. It’s pretty amazing to see AI being used to connect us more with the awesome creatures we share the planet with!</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ll admit, even <em>I</em> raised an eyebrow at <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/why-use-google-pixel-phone-poll-result-3540253/">the results of this Pixel poll</a>. I mean, 4,700 people? That&rsquo;s a decent sample size, I suppose. Still, the reasons they cited&hellip; well, let&rsquo;s just say they weren&rsquo;t exactly groundbreaking. Especially when you consider the iPhone juggernaut – you know, the one that&rsquo;s seemingly glued to the hands of 50-60% of the US population (and growing, I&rsquo;m sure). <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/us-smartphone-market-share/">According to Counterpoint Research, as of Q4 2024.</a>. But, I digress. Android Authority asked a simple question: &lsquo;Why do you use a Pixel phone?&rsquo; And the answers&hellip; were revealing, to say the least.</p>
<p>Back in my day – and yes, I&rsquo;m going to start this that way – Google&rsquo;s Pixel line was the underdog. The scrappy kid on the block, fighting against the Samsungs and Apples of the world. They weren&rsquo;t just selling a phone; they were selling <em>the</em> Android experience. Pure, unadulterated, straight from the source. Remember the Nexus days? (Those were the <em>real</em> Pixels, if you ask me.) Google promised us innovation, a camera that could rival the best, and software that was always one step ahead. And for a while, they delivered. But somewhere along the line – and I&rsquo;m looking at you, Pixel 6 – things started to&hellip; stagnate. The competition caught up, and Google&rsquo;s &lsquo;exclusive&rsquo; features started feeling less &lsquo;exclusive&rsquo; and more &lsquo;finally catching up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the big takeaway from this survey? Apparently, people buy Pixels for a laundry list of reasons: camera, exclusive features, safety, stock Android – the &lsquo;all of the above&rsquo; crowd. And look, I get it. There&rsquo;s a certain appeal to a phone that tries to do everything well. But here&rsquo;s the thing: that&rsquo;s not a strength <em>yet</em>, but it has the potential to be. Right now, it feels a bit like a jack-of-all-trades situation. The camera? Solid, reliable – but can it truly claim to be the best anymore? &lsquo;Exclusive&rsquo; features? Some are genuinely useful, others&hellip; less so. Safety? Absolutely a plus, no argument there. And stock Android? A clean, bloat-free experience is always appreciated. But the question remains: where&rsquo;s the <em>spark</em>? Where&rsquo;s the innovation that made the early Pixels so exciting? They&rsquo;re good, even very good – but they could be so much more.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be real, the AI features are where Google&rsquo;s Pixel is still king – or at least, a solid prince. Magic Eraser? Magic Editor? Game changers. I&rsquo;ve seen Apple&rsquo;s attempt at a cleanup tool, and frankly, it&rsquo;s like comparing a Picasso to a finger painting – impressive for a toddler, less so for a trillion-dollar company. And don&rsquo;t even get me started on call screening and spam detection. Life before these features was like navigating a minefield of robocalls and sketchy texts. Now? It&rsquo;s like having a personal assistant who actually knows what they&rsquo;re doing. Then there&rsquo;s the little things – the &lsquo;Now Playing&rsquo; feature that identifies songs without you lifting a finger, the real-time translation that actually works in noisy environments, the way the camera just <em>gets</em> the right shot, even in tricky lighting. These aren&rsquo;t just gimmicks; they&rsquo;re genuinely useful AI-powered tools that make your life easier. And while the competition is scrambling to catch up, Google&rsquo;s Pixel is still setting the pace. (Though, let&rsquo;s be honest, they could still push the envelope a bit more. <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-sense-3531570/">Imagine what they could do if they truly leaned into &lsquo;Pixel Sense&rsquo; and integrated all those sensors and AI into a seamless, contextual experience&hellip;</a></p>
<p>So, where does this leave us? Pixel, in its current state, is a paradox. It&rsquo;s a phone that excels at the mundane – the everyday tasks, the little annoyances that AI can smooth over. But it&rsquo;s also a phone that&rsquo;s lost its edge, its sense of daring. It&rsquo;s become&hellip; safe. Too safe. And in a market that&rsquo;s constantly evolving, constantly pushing boundaries, &lsquo;safe&rsquo; is a death sentence. Google needs to remember what made Pixel special in the first place – the innovation, the willingness to take risks. They need to stop playing it safe and start pushing the envelope again. Because if they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;ll find themselves not just trailing behind the competition, but forgotten altogether. And that – that would be a tragedy.&quot;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already migrated my data, but many people are hesitant, waiting on seeing how Google handles the merge. So far, I&rsquo;ve noticed that Google has gone out of their way to mitigate any wrongful assumptions. <a href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/13532616?hl=en">Google has explicitly stated</a> that they won&rsquo;t use user health data for selling ads or sell data at all.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s reputation with user data has been consistent with its transparency and control stance, giving users full control over their data.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A recent update to the Fitbit app appears to have introduced a significant bug affecting how exercise data, specifically pace and lap information, is displayed. Users have taken to the Fitbit community forums to voice their frustration over wildly inaccurate metrics showing up after their workouts.</p>
<p>The issue gained traction last year in a thread titled &ldquo;<a href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Android-App/Pace-Lap-display-in-Exercise/td-p/5658602/page/9#M187912">Pace/Lap display in Exercise</a>&rdquo;, where the original poster described a confusing discrepancy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>From Jdmcb66:</strong> <em>&ldquo;I have a Charge 6 and Iphone and within the past few days my laps/pace on my exercise details page has gone crazy. I walked tonight, 2.23 Miles at average 19' pace. The detail at the bottom says Lap 1 - 11'41&rdquo;/mi = 3.63 miles. I know my laps are set at 1.0 mi. I have gone back and earlier exercises that had lap1, lap 2, etc&hellip; now have similar one lap with ludicrous distances and no individual laps. This makes me nuts, as a runner I want to know what my lap times are for training and improvement.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Investigating the forum thread reveals this isn&rsquo;t an isolated incident affecting only one type of device pairing. Comments pour in from a mix of users, including longtime Fitbit device runners using iPhones and newer users pairing Pixel Watches with Pixel phones. The common denominator is the Fitbit app exhibiting incorrect calculations, consolidating multiple laps into one inaccurate entry and misreporting distances and paces.</p>
<p>This problem was highlighted to me recently within the Pixel Superfan community. One member expressed their disappointment quite directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;So the fitbit app is now useless for tracking exercise because they are doing incorrect unit conversions.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For users who rely on detailed lap splits and accurate pace information for training purposes, this bug renders a core function of the Fitbit experience unreliable. While Fitbit moderators <a href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Android-App/Pace-Lap-display-in-Exercise/m-p/5736610/highlight/true#M187912">have acknowledged the issue</a> and yesterday said for users to update their Fitbit app to the latest update available (4.38 or higher) to receive the fix, but users are still seeing the issue and are eagerly await a fix to restore accurate exercise tracking. For Google to position the Pixel Watch 3 with pace and laptop tracking to be the device for runners, Google needs to get this right before users switch to competing fitness trackers.</p>

			 <p>I recently did a Google Meet call with my parents to help them set up their Google Voice number system for their Church Ministry and it was such a seamless experience.</p>
<p>Here are a few things I absolutely loved:</p>
<h2 id="share-screen-on-google-meet">&lsquo;Share Screen&rsquo; on Google Meet</h2>
<p>Being able to see what&rsquo;s on my parent&rsquo;s screen to walk them through setting up their Google Voice number worked wonders. I could have just used <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chrome-remote-desktop/inomeogfingihgjfjlpeplalcfajhgai?hl=en">Chrome Remote Desktop (CRM)</a> and took control of their mouse with their permission to set it up for them, but I wanted them to learn it on their own with my guided instructions. I&rsquo;ve used CRM in the past and that too works great.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="google-meet-switch-here">Google Meet &lsquo;Switch Here&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Being able to quickly switch between Chrome and Android devices is so seamless, my 70 year old dad was able to do it. After I walked him through setting up his Google Voice number on the computer, I wanted to walk him through installing Google Voice on his Android phone. I told him to &ldquo;join the meeting on your phone&rdquo; and he noticed the &ldquo;Switch Here&rdquo; icon. Tapping on that brought him right into the call, quickly removing himself from the call on the computer and adding him back on his phone. That way we could do another Share Screen from his Android phone.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/googlemeetdevicetransferswitchhere.jpg" alt="Auto-generated description: A video call is taking place on Google Meet, displayed on both a smartphone and a computer screen, featuring individuals participating in a virtual meeting."></p>
<h2 id="googles-material-design-language">Google&rsquo;s Material Design Language</h2>
<p>Something so subtle, but incredibly intuitive is Google&rsquo;s cohesive icons and material design language. Because my parents have been using an Android device for at least a decade now, they are familiar with the Google Material Design icons. Telling them to &ldquo;tap on the settings icon&rdquo;, &ldquo;tap on the messages icon&rdquo; or &ldquo;tap the menu icon&rdquo;, they immediately know I&rsquo;m referring to the &ldquo;gear icon&rdquo;, &ldquo;the message bubble icon&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;three dots&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/unnamed.png" alt="Auto-generated description: A collection of 32 white, line-style icons representing various objects and actions, such as a heart, bell, map, phone, and shopping cart, arranged in a grid on a dark background."></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great experiences like this that let me know I made the right choice in providing my parents with an affordable Chromebook and Android device now that they are retired. They get so much done without having to break the bank with the peace of mind of speed, simplicity, and security with their devices. Especially since they are the envy of their friends because of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2IyttWHJfs">Pixel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Call Screening&rdquo; feature</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The world of artificial intelligence keeps moving fast, and<a href="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/03/22/inside-googles-twoyear-frenzy-to.html"> Google DeepMind is definitely staying near the front of the pack</a>.<a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/#building-on-best-gemini"> News coming out</a> of the research group points toward Gemini 2.5, the next step up from their already impressive Gemini AI models. While we don&rsquo;t have all the technical details yet, Google is highlighting a big jump in the model&rsquo;s ability to &ldquo;think.&rdquo; This isn&rsquo;t just about crunching more data or writing longer paragraphs; it seems they&rsquo;re really focused on making the AI better at reasoning, planning things out, and following complex instructions. For tech watchers and folks like me interested in where this is all going, this focus on cognition is key. It&rsquo;s about moving AI beyond just recognizing patterns and predicting the next word. The goal is systems that can truly get the intent behind a request, break down tricky problems, and work towards a goal. The potential improvements in Gemini 2.5 could start closing the gap between today&rsquo;s AI, which handles specific tasks well, and a future AI that acts more like a thinking partner. It&rsquo;s like the difference between a really fast calculator and someone who can actually formulate a complex strategy; Google looks to be nudging Gemini in that more advanced direction.</p>
<p>Achieving this better reasoning involves refining the underlying AI architecture. We&rsquo;ll likely see new techniques, maybe related to Chain-of-Thought ideas or better ways for the model to keep track of information internally. This would allow it to hold context longer, check its own work mid-task, and switch tactics if needed when dealing with complicated, multi-part problems. For example, as a developer, I might want an AI to do more than just spit out a code snippet. I could ask it to design a whole feature for a web app – maybe something involving JavaScript and Tailwind CSS on the front end, with PHP handling things in the back, possibly interacting with Drupal – while considering scalability, security, and coding standards.</p>

<p>Current models can stumble over such broad requests, needing a lot of back-and-forth. Gemini 2.5, with its boosted planning and reasoning, aims to understand and tackle these complex instructions more effectively right from the start, which could seriously speed up workflows and open doors for more creative development. Better reasoning also means the AI should get better at handling fuzzy language and understanding subtle meanings, which is crucial for natural interaction. The impact goes way beyond just developer tools; think about smarter information discovery in Search, more helpful automation in Workspace, and richer experiences on Android. That last part is especially interesting to me, given my preference for Android and devices like my Pixel 9 Pro. As Google weaves these smarter models into everything they do, Gemini 2.5&rsquo;s improved &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; could bring real, noticeable benefits, making tech feel more intuitive and powerful. Pulling this off takes massive computing power and research talent, showing Google DeepMind&rsquo;s significant role in pushing AI forward globally.</p>
<p>Looking closer at what &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; means for an AI, the upgrades suggested for Gemini 2.5 go well beyond just knowing facts or writing smoothly. Better reasoning points to a stronger grasp of logic, cause-and-effect, and the ability to spot inconsistencies in information. This could lead to AI systems that not only answer tough questions correctly but can also explain <em>how</em> they got the answer, building more trust. Picture an AI tutor guiding a student step-by-step through a tricky problem, or a research tool comparing conflicting sources and pointing out the differences. The focus on planning and handling multi-step tasks suggests the AI has a better internal sense of the world and can work towards a goal methodically. Instead of just reacting to the last thing said, Gemini 2.5 looks designed to map out a sequence of actions, maybe even predict roadblocks, and stick to a strategy to complete a complex user request. This ability is vital for everything from self-driving systems needing to navigate busy streets to project management software that can break down big objectives into smaller, manageable steps.</p>
<p>In web development, this cognitive sophistication could mean an AI assistant that understands a high-level feature idea, sketches out the necessary front-end (JS, Tailwind) and back-end (PHP, maybe Drupal hooks) pieces, suggests database changes, writes starting code for different modules, and even proposes how to test it all. That’s a much more involved and proactive partner than one just giving isolated code examples. This level of smarts demands serious computational resources, both for training the model and running it, plus clever new algorithms and efficient designs. Google DeepMind is likely using advanced techniques, possibly including sophisticated feedback loops during training that specifically reward good reasoning and planning, along with architectural tweaks for more structured thinking. As an Android fan, the idea of this advanced reasoning running efficiently enough for on-device tasks on future Pixels or other devices is really appealing, potentially enabling next-level Google Assistant features or other integrations that feel truly intelligent without needing the cloud for every little thought. Of course, this increased capability also brings significant responsibility. Google knows the ethical tightrope that comes with powerful AI. Developing Gemini 2.5 surely includes deep safety checks and work on alignment to prevent misuse, reduce bias, and ensure the AI behaves in ways we want. The road to human-like artificial general intelligence is still very long, but steps like Gemini 2.5 are major markers along the way, expanding what machines can understand and do, and bringing us closer to AI that doesn&rsquo;t just process data, but genuinely &ldquo;thinks&rdquo; in ever more useful ways.</p>

		<a href="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/03/26/google-shifts-android-development-to.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-03-26 08:38:26 -0700">Mar 26, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In a significant move, Google has announced that it will be transitioning to fully private development of the Android operating system after 16 years. This change, confirmed by Google to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-development-aosp-3538503/">Android Authority</a>, aims to streamline the development process and reduce discrepancies between public and internal branches.</p>
<p>Previously, Google shared some development work on the public AOSP Gerrit. Now, all development will occur internally. Google has committed to publishing source code to AOSP after each release. While AOSP accepts third-party contributions, Google primarily drives development to ensure Android&rsquo;s vitality as a platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://androiddev.social/@MishaalRahman/114229233161222027">Mishaal Rahman makes one thing clear over on Mastodon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Just to be clear: Android is NOT becoming closed source!</p>
<p>Google remains committed to releasing Android source code (during monthly/quarterly releases, etc.) , BUT you won&rsquo;t be able to scour the AOSP Gerrit for source code changes like you could before.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shift will likely have minimal impact on regular users and most developers, including app and platform developers. However, external developers who actively contribute to AOSP will experience reduced insight into Google&rsquo;s development efforts. Reporters will also have less access to potentially revealing information previously found in AOSP patches. Google has stated that it will announce further details and new documentation on <a href="https://source.android.com">source.android.com</a>.</p>

			 <p>A 13 year long iPhone customer, finally made the switch from iPhone to the Google Pixel 9 Pro and he shared some great feedback about his experience using Pixel. Some of them are just the difference from being in a closed-ecosystem, controlled by one company and moving to a more open-ecosystem semi-controlled by one company, but with the philosophy of an open-ecosystem. If that makes sense. I provided <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jj644v/comment/mjowpaw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">my comments</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jj644v/dear_google_lets_talk_about_the_pixel/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">the person&rsquo;s post on reddit</a>. I&rsquo;ve share them below. The original redditor&rsquo;s comments are in the green. Mine are in between. Enjoy.</p>
<p>I love all of these suggestions and would welcome all of these, but I&rsquo;d like to share my thoughts on these. I&rsquo;ll skip the first one since that was positive feedback.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2. <strong>Improve the Tensor Chip</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Make the Tensor chip as fast as the top-tier Snapdragon or the latest iPhone’s chip. I’ve noticed some lag, especially when gaming. Sure, 99% of people don’t game heavily on their phones, but when you have an iPhone, you know it can handle it if you want. That’s a feeling of security.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is coming with time. Both Qualcomm and Apple have been making their own chips for more than a decade now. Google partnering with Samsung in their Tensor White Chapel and newer chips was to jumpstart Google&rsquo;s experience in making their own chips, while still being able to customize the and tweak the AI experience on their own devices. Similar to how Apple learned from Intel before switching to their own silicon. Overall, I think this is coming, but with a caveat. Google will more than likely rely on the combination and collaboration of Cloud computing. So raw power locally won&rsquo;t always been the focus. Especially since it requires a whole lot more R&amp;D, will eat into margins, and they&rsquo;ll more than likely raise the price of devices even more than the usual economical increases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3. <strong>Enhance Video Recording</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You guys take incredible photos, so keep it up. But please work on getting the video quality closer to iPhone levels—especially when switching lenses mid-recording.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right on with this and I think Google is surely advancing here. Even <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-google-built-tensor-g5-3535489/#:~:text=The%20Tensor%20G5%20will%20have%20a%20fully%20custom%20ISP%20from%20the%20front%2Dend%20to%20the%20back%2Dend%20parts%20of%20the%20pipeline">adding their own custom ISP</a> as well as replace &ldquo;BigWave&rdquo; (Google&rsquo;s in-house video codec) with WAVE677DV suggesting that the latter may offer advantages in areas such as performance, power efficiency, or a combination of factors, along with the added benefit of multi-format support on the new Tensor G5 chip coming this fall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4. <strong>Optimize Your Own Apps</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some Google apps are smoother on iPhone than on Pixel. Why is Google Maps smoother on iPhone, for example? Please optimize your apps to perform best on your own phone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually found Google Maps works better on Pixel than it has on iPhone. At least for me in the past. This is obviously anecdotal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5. <strong>Get Third-Party Apps Onboard</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure popular social media and messaging apps are optimized for Pixel. This is crucial for everyday use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want this to, and Google has worked with IG, Snap, and the YouTube team for a few years and has added some exclusives that aren&rsquo;t available on iOS. Like Night Sight in Instagram, Live video switching between Pixel&rsquo;s, and Live Transcribe. Still there is a lot more work that needs to be done and the CameraX API is the key. Fragmentation is the issue here and Google having to balance prioritizing Pixel or Android comes into play.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6. <strong>Merge Google Meet &amp; Messages</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider blending Google Meet and Google Messages into one seamless experience (similar to FaceTime, iMessages). It would simplify communication across Android ecosystem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From my understanding, it&rsquo;s the same. Messages and Facetime are two completely different apps. You can uninstall Facetime and still have Messages. I assume that when you can uninstall Messages on iOS, you can still use Facetime. I might not fully understand what you mean here, but I think they are pretty similar. I think WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal are the only ones that truly have it blended. But, AFAIK Google Meet and Google Messages are to what Apple Facetime and Apple Messages are today in terms as a seamless experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7. <strong>Add Built-In Magnets</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Implement magnets inside the phone (like MagSafe on iPhone). There are tons of accessories that rely on this feature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not opposed to this, but is it absolutely needed? Most people have a case on their phone. Does the Pixel need magnets if more cases have magnets? I think that&rsquo;s up for debate. I know a lot of people like to go caseless, but anecdotally, for every caseless courageous person I see in public, I see 10 cas(r)eful cautious people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>8. <strong>Strengthen the Ecosystem</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One major reason people stick with iPhone is because of Apple’s ecosystem. Web apps are fine, but if possible, create native desktop apps (Messages, video calling, Notes, Reminders, Calendar, Photos, etc.) for both Mac and Windows. That would help lure more people in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would native desktop apps do that? Why? To what metric? What benefit do customers get from having a native Messages app as opposed to a Web one? Web apps don&rsquo;t take up space on the local machine and web apps can be wherever you are. If the features are consistent between the two, I don&rsquo;t see the want and need for that.</p>
<p>As for the ecosystem, I agree, and that definitely takes a lot more time because Google can&rsquo;t and probably won&rsquo;t force any OEM, Developer, etc&hellip; to do things that solely benefit Google. <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones">Apple can and does do that </a>at the expense of third-party accessory makers and developers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>9. <strong>Bolster Core Android Features</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep improving Android at its core. Make it even more robust, smooth, and user-friendly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No notes. This is good. Progression is good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10. <strong>Elevate the Watch Experience</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pixel Watch needs more attention. Aim to match (or beat) the Apple Watch’s functionality, integration, and polish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hear this a lot but I don&rsquo;t think people are ready to spend $700 to $800 on a Pixel Watch. It&rsquo;s still new and getting as many Pixel Watch experiences out of the door as possibly is more important with the balance of providing premium fitness experiences. I think for Google only having made 3 watches, they&rsquo;ve done great. Remember, Samsung and Apple have had watch accessory businesses for at least 10 years. That comes with time, but Pixel is advancing at a fast pace. With all that said, I do think the Pixel Watch needs smoother animations and better loading performance. UX journey in and out of apps need to be a lot more polished with animations coming from a specific point on the screen instead of just appearing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lastly, a Big One:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Google is known for killing projects quickly, which might be great for engineers, but from a customer’s standpoint, it shows a lack of long-term commitment. When you launch something, it’s hard for us to fully adopt it because we suspect it’ll be discontinued. That attitude does more harm to your reputation than anything else. Please rethink it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <strong>LOVE</strong> this one and totally agree. I think because of the massive backlash and killing of extra weight/messaging apps, Google is at a lean place that seems to be holding on to things as they are today. Google Assistant going away isn&rsquo;t a killing. It&rsquo;s an evolution. However, there are times where it makes sense to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/18/should-apple-kill-siri/">kill something that just isn&rsquo;t working or hasn&rsquo;t been working for years now</a>.</p>
<p>This is great feedback from a long-time iPhone customer. Some things just don&rsquo;t apply to Android and even Google. I will say, though, that if you expect Google to completely control and force their hand on things like Apple does, you will be disappointed.</p>

<p>This report comes from a combination of The Informational and 9to5Google.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;…after a leadership review, employees working on the product were told Pichai had ordered a change of direction to ensure the new product didn’t compete with the Gemini assistant, which operates across all of Google’s Android devices, according to a person with direct knowledge of the instructions.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a consistency standpoint, this makes sense. Google&rsquo;s history is stained with a lot of half-cooked up duplicates of messaging platforms and this would&rsquo;ve been another one of those. I&rsquo;m glad they went with the larger scale Gemini plan instead. I do hope that Google provides a way to make Gemini more contextual with what&rsquo;s on-device.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-openai-gemini-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence/">&ldquo;Inside Google’s Two-Year Frenzy to Catch Up With OpenAI&rdquo; by Paresh Dave and Arielle of Wires</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To build the new ChatGPT rival, codenamed Bard, former employees say Hsiao plucked about 100 people from teams across Google. Managers had no choice in the matter, according to a former search employee: Bard took precedence over everything else. Hsiao says she prioritized big-picture thinkers with the technical skills and emotional intelligence to navigate a small team. Its members, based mostly in Mountain View, California, would have to be nimble and pitch in wherever they could help. “You’re Team Bard,” Hsiao told them. “You wear all the hats.”</p>
<p>In January 2023, Pichai announced the first mass layoffs in the company’s history—12,000 jobs, about 7 percent of the workforce. “No one knew what exactly to do to be safe going forward,” says a former engineering manager. Some employees worried that if they didn’t put in overtime, they would quickly lose their jobs. If that meant disrupting kids’ bedtime routines to join Team Bard’s evening meetings, so be it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember, not long ago, when Bard was announced and feeling like Google was being left behind. Bard felt safe and rushed and plenty of people were calling OpenAIs ChatGPT the next Google if not just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/10ikwm2/will_chatgpt_eventually_replace_google_search/?rdt=37110">fully replacing Google</a>. Reading through this profile proves to me that OpenAI being the new player in the game of innovation, not having as much guardrails, was perfect for Google to ignite competition within their walls.</p>
<p>Josh Woodward, lead on Google Labs, explains the vigor within Google:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;AROUND 6:30 ONE evening in March 2024, two Google employees showed up at Josh Woodward’s desk in the yellow zone of Gradient Canopy. Woodward leads Google Labs, a rapid-launch unit charged with turning research into entirely new products, and the employees were eager for him to hear what they had created. Using transcripts of UK Parliament hearings and the Gemini model with long context, they had generated a podcast called Westminster Watch with two AI hosts, Kath and Simon. The episode opened with Simon speaking in a cheery British accent: “It’s been another lively week in the House, with plenty of drama, debate, and even a dash of history.” Woodward was riveted. Afterward, he says, he went around telling everyone about it, including Pichai.</p>
<p>The text-to-podcast tool, known as NotebookLM Audio Overviews, was added to the lineup for that May’s Google I/O conference. A core team worked around the clock, nights and weekends, to get it ready, Woodward told WIRED. “I mean, they literally have listened at this point to thousands and thousands” of AI-generated podcasts, he said.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I personally thought NotebookLM was incredibly impressive when I was in attendance at I/O 2024. It felt like Google Duplex, but on steroids. It felt like Google had been woken up from a slumber of complacency and lack of competition really gunning for them. Just looking at their <a href="https://ai.google/advancing-ai/milestones/?section=gnome">AI Journey</a> page shows just how quickly things ramped up after 2021. I think Google is still just getting started. My prediction is that within these next two years, Google is going to ship even more fleshed out products across their Platform and Services team.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve always appreciated the flexibility of Android. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve switched between Android and iPhone, and back to Android, and I&rsquo;ve noticed consistent issues within the iPhone experience that ultimately led me back to Android. A recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1jasi0m/switched_from_pixel_7_to_iphone_16_pro_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit post from u/Pucky22</a>, who switched from a Pixel 7 to an iPhone 16 Pro, echoes many of my own experiences.

Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the user&rsquo;s observations, and my own perspective.</p>
<h1 id="analyzing-the-good">Analyzing &ldquo;The Good&rdquo;</h1>
<p>Pucky22 highlighting several positive aspects of the iPhone 16 Pro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hardware Quality</strong>: A really nice piece of hardware. Beautiful, solid, and feels great in hand. The Pro model is a good size—big but not too bulky.</p>
<p><strong>Screen</strong>: Looks fantastic. No complaints.</p>
<p><strong>Camera &amp; Video</strong>: Takes excellent shots, and from all accounts, the video quality is top-tier.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Island</strong>: First time hearing about it, but it’s actually pretty cool. Having sports scores and music controls right there is surprisingly useful.</p>
<p><strong>Software Touches</strong>: Some effects and animations are really smooth—like when scanning a document, it isolates the background and seamlessly moves it into the corner.</p>
<p><strong>CarPlay</strong>: This surprised me. When catching up on notifications, it gives a natural-language summary of missed messages, which is really nice.</p>
<p>The <strong>Apple Maps</strong> navigation voice and style is very natural and smooth—I actually prefer it to Google Maps. I guess the days of being navigated into a lake are over for Apple Maps!</p>
<p><strong>Grouped Notifications</strong>: While I still think Android does notifications better, Apple’s grouping and summarization of same-app notifications is intelligently designed and useful.</p>
<p><strong>FaceID</strong>: When you’re holding the phone, FaceID works perfectly—fast and accurate. However, if the phone is sitting on a desk or table, FaceID often won’t pick up your face unless you awkwardly lean over it. A fingerprint reader would be a really nice option in those situations.</p>
<p><strong>Standby Mode</strong>: Standby mode at night, with the bedside alarm clock in red, was actually very nice and well-designed. It’s subtle but easy to read at night without being harsh on the eyes. Also, the default iPhone alarm tone is exceptionally pleasing—way better than the jarring tones I’m used to on Android.</p>
<p><strong>GenMoji Seems Fun</strong>: I didn’t even try it once, but I bet it’s cool for those who are into that sort of thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pucky22 praised the iPhone&rsquo;s hardware, display, and camera, and found features like Dynamic Island and CarPlay&rsquo;s notification summaries to be surprisingly useful. They also noted the smooth software animations, improved Apple Maps, and well-designed Standby Mode. All of those to which I also share the same sentiment.</p>
<h1 id="analyzing-the-bad">Analyzing &ldquo;The Bad&rdquo;</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>However, the user&rsquo;s experience wasn&rsquo;t entirely positive. The user encountered several significant issues with iOS.</p>
<p>These aren’t new complaints about iOS, but for someone using it as a main device, they are massive hurdles.</p>
<p><strong>The Keyboard is Borderline Unusable</strong>. Whether using the stock keyboard or Gboard on iOS, the experience is awful. So many typos, wrong key presses—it’s just bad. The Gboard on my old Pixel 7 was 1000x more accurate and faster to type on. It has been consistently infuriating. I had no idea just how much better the Android keyboard was.</p>
<p><strong>Notifications = Anxiety Machine</strong>. iPhone is aggressive with notifications—way more than I was used to. On Android, you can easily choose which notifications for a given app should be silent or not, right from the notification itself—just a quick tap and done. On iPhone, it’s a much more laborious process, requiring you to dig into settings manually for each app. This makes it way harder to fine-tune notifications to be useful instead of overwhelming.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of Settings…</strong> Why is there a whole app called “Settings” instead of just swiping down and tapping an icon to adjust things quickly? Having to navigate through an app for simple things like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is an unnecessary step.</p>
<p><strong>No App Drawer</strong>. This is insane. Instead of a clean app drawer, you have to either search for apps (which is fine but not intuitive) or look through Apple&rsquo;s pre-made categories in the App Library. The grouping seems neat at first glance but ends up being a wild choice in actual use. Why do I have to rely on Apple to decide where my apps go?</p>
<p><strong>CarPlay Layout is a Mess</strong>. Apple Maps is actually pretty solid now—natural-sounding navigation, accurate directions—but the overall CarPlay interface is clunky compared to Android Auto.If you use Google Maps on CarPlay (without a car screen, just on your phone), you can only get in-app media controls for Spotify or Apple Music—not YouTube Music. Why??</p>
<p><strong>iMessage is Seriously Underwhelming</strong>. I was expecting more. RCS on Android does the same thing (minus the blue bubble “exclusivity”), so the fact that Apple has built an entire bullying ecosystem around this feels ridiculous. WhatsApp does all of this and works across devices.</p>
<p><strong>No iMessage on a PC?</strong> This was a shock. I use a PC for work, and I was stunned to realize that iMessage has no web or Windows version. With Google Messages, WhatsApp, or basically any other modern messaging platform, I could just open a browser and continue conversations while working. With iPhone? Nope. Either use a Mac or be stuck switching between my phone and computer constantly.</p>
<p><strong>Transferring Old Messages From Android Was a Nightmare</strong>. This was infuriating. There’s no native way to do it, so I had to try a third-party, expensive app—and even that still didn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>Homescreen Organization is a Disaster</strong>. On Android, I can place apps and widgets where I want—maybe I have a family photo as my wallpaper and don’t want anything covering faces. On iPhone? Move one app and the whole homescreen shifts like a chaotic game of Tetris. If you try to put an app in a folder, it’s like chasing a toddler at bedtime. Just… why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pucky22&rsquo;s experience highlights the strengths and weaknesses of switching to iOS from Android, and mirrors my own experiences. Even to the point where when the last time I owned an iPhone 12 last year was to communicate with my church team through iMessage. Since Apple enabled RCS on iOS 18, I was able to completely be unreliant on the iPhone and ultimately sell it. While the hardware and some software features are impressive, iOS has significant usability issues. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the premium Android smartphone market is much stronger now than it once was. Companies like Google, Samsung, OnePlus, and Motorola have really stepped up, offering compelling alternatives in the high-end segment. So now when people ask me why I no longer use an iPhone. I&rsquo;ll share with them this blog post because it&rsquo;s a lofty question that deservant of a lofty answer.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-10-startup-performance-3537302/">Mishaal Rahman on Android Authority:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I was browsing the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code review last week, I spotted a code change that explicitly references the Pixel 10. In the description for the code change titled “Parallel Module Loading: Add performance mode,” a Google engineer says the change was tested on a Pixel 10, resulting in a 30% reduction in “loading time.”</p>
<p>The change was also tested on a Pixel Fold, though, which means it isn’t specific to next-generation hardware. Instead, it’ll impact all Android-based devices once it makes its way to Android’s open source codebase, likely in a quarterly release of Android 16. That’s because it impacts a key part of the bootup process shared by all Android devices.</p>
<p>It’s rare — but not totally unheard of — to see explicit references to unreleased hardware in AOSP; as far as I know, this is the first public mention of the Pixel 10 outside of leaks, though it’s not like we didn’t already know it existed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/11/google-pixel-10-cad-render-leak-design/">the leaks</a>, and noticed that the external design of the Pixel 10 mirrors the Pixel 9 series. What that tells me is what Mishaal is discovering. Most of what will be elevated on the Pixel 10 is the internals: software and hardware. I&rsquo;d consider the Pixel 10 to be Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;S-year&rdquo;. If Pixel 9 was in the A-tier, the Pixel 10 is having a lot of performance tweaks on the software and hardware to bring it to the S-tier. The biggest question I have though is that since the regular Pixel 10 is getting a telephoto, just like the Pro-tier, what will be the differentiator among the two?</p>

		<a href="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/03/20/pixel-a-when-gb-ram.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-03-20 13:02:58 -0700">Mar 20, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rwhitwam.bsky.social">Ryan Whitwam</a> at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/meager-8gb-of-ram-forces-pixel-9a-to-run-extra-extra-small-gemini-ai/">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pixel 9a has less RAM than the flagship Pixels, which standardized on 12GB largely to provide Gemini Nano with reserved memory without impeding performance. However, the Pixel 9a still just has 8GB of memory, which is a problem for local AI processing. This is the first Google phone to ship with a new super-small AI model. It saves on resources but can&rsquo;t support some of the best Pixel AI features.</p>
<p>This is a familiar problem for Google, which initially disappointed Pixel 8 owners last year when it said Gemini Nano wouldn&rsquo;t come to that phone. Google reversed course several weeks later and released Gemini Nano as a developer preview despite the phone only having 8GB of RAM. Google confirms this preview was the first appearance of the XXS Gemini AI that now runs on the Pixel 9a out of the box.</p>
<p>To make Gemini Nano run well on a device with 8GB of RAM, Google had to make some sacrifices. On the more minor side, Gemini Nano 1.0 XXS doesn&rsquo;t run continuously in the background, unlike the flagship Pixels. The Pixel 9a only loads Gemini XXS (and eats into your RAM) when the model is needed, which might make some features a bit less responsive. A more serious drawback is the lack of multimodality—Gemini Nano 1.0 XXS is text-only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is fine. Most people that purchase a Pixel 9a will barely notice the lack features like Pixel Screenshots and Call Notes. Both are super useful features, which you can get on the Pixel 9 that you can currently get for the same price as the Pixel 9a. And even so. If people shout loud enough, Google might add it later similar to how they did with the Pixel 8.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s plausible that the majority of Pixel 9a purchasers may remain largely oblivious to the absence of features such as Pixel Screenshots and Call Notes. While these functionalities are undoubtedly beneficial, they are available on the Pixel 9, which currently <a href="https://swappa.com/listings/google-pixel-9?carrier=unlocked&amp;color=&amp;storage=&amp;modeln=&amp;condition=new&amp;sort=">retails at a comparable price point</a> to the Pixel 9a. I believe that plenty of user advocacy could prompt Google to subsequently introduce these features, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/28/24114078/google-pixel-8-gemini-nano-on-device-ai">mirroring their previous actions</a> with the Pixel 8.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve received it on my Pixel 9 Pro and though I don&rsquo;t plan on going on any hikes up Mt.

			 <p>Damien from 9to5Google recently shared his initial impressions of the upcoming Google Pixel 9a in a YouTube video. His experience seems to confirm what many have anticipated: the Pixel 9a is shaping up to be another compelling, value-driven offering in Google&rsquo;s smartphone lineup.</p>
<p>The Pixel A-series has a history of disrupting the market, going back to the Pixel 3a. These devices manage to pack the same impressive software features found in their flagship counterparts, like the Pixel 9, while making strategic hardware compromises to achieve a more accessible price point. From what we can gather, the Pixel 9a continues this tradition.</p>
<p>One of the standout features mentioned is the impressive 5,100 mAh battery, which would be the largest battery ever included in a Pixel phone. This alone suggests a significant improvement in battery life, addressing a common concern for many smartphone users.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the full spec sheet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biggest battery in a Pixel (5100mAh)</li>
<li>6.3&quot; FHD OLED display @ 120Hz</li>
<li>Tensor G4 processor</li>
<li>8 GB RAM + 128/256GB storage</li>
<li>7 years of software updates</li>
<li>Starts @ $499 USD</li>
</ul>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t have the phone with me, thus the reason I can&rsquo;t pass any full judgement, but looking at previous A-series models and information from the <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_9a_specs?hl=en-US">Google Store website</a> suggests that the Pixel 9a might feature slightly smaller camera sensors and potentially less RAM compared to the flagship Pixel 9. However, these are often calculated trade-offs that still deliver excellent performance and a fantastic camera experience, which the Pixel line is known for.</p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m looking forward to getting my hands on the Porcelain color variant and will be sharing my initial review soon. I also plan to follow up with an <a href="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/02/21/google-pixel-a-review-a.html">end-of-year review</a> to provide a more comprehensive assessment after extended use.</p>
<p>As the sixth iteration in the Pixel A-series, the Pixel 9a further solidifies Google&rsquo;s commitment to the smartphone market. For those who have doubted their staying power, the continued release of compelling devices like the Pixel 9a speaks volumes. Google&rsquo;s Pixel is indeed here to stay.</p>

			 <p>Eric Migicovsky, the creator of Pebble, recently<a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones"> reignited a familiar debate</a>: Apple&rsquo;s restrictive policies on iOS significantly hinder the functionality of third-party smartwatches. In a recent blog post, Migicovsky detailed the numerous challenges Pebble faced, and continues to face, in providing a competitive smartwatch experience for iPhone users.</p>
<p>With the latest announcement of new Pebble watches, <a href="https://store.repebble.com/">Pebble is making a resurgence</a>.</p>
<p>Migicovsky&rsquo;s post highlights a core issue: Apple&rsquo;s control over its ecosystem. He argues that Apple uses its market power to lock consumers in, stifling competition and innovation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Apple claims their restrictions on competitors are only about security, privacy, crafting a better experience etc etc. At least that’s what they tell you as they tuck you into bed. I personally don’t agree - they’re clearly using their market power to lock consumers into their walled ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This &ldquo;walled garden&rdquo; approach, while potentially beneficial for Apple&rsquo;s bottom line, creates a disadvantage for other smartwatch makers. Migicovsky points out that basic functionalities, like sending text messages or replying to notifications, are simply impossible for non-Apple Watches on iPhones.</p>
<p>The difficulties extend beyond user-facing features. Migicovsky also discusses the challenges developers face:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It’s very difficult to enable other iOS apps to work with Pebble. Basically iOS does not have the concept of ‘interprocess communication’(IPC) like on Android.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This limitation makes it harder for third-party apps to integrate with Pebble, creating a less seamless experience compared to the Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Migicovsky&rsquo;s post isn&rsquo;t just a list of complaints. It&rsquo;s a call to action. He urges users to voice their concerns and support legislation aimed at promoting more open competition. He also mentions the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in Europe, and plans to petition Apple under DMA Article 6.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you live in Europe, thank you for voting for representatives who passed the DMA. We will be petitioning Apple under DMA Article 6 to request interoperability with Apple Watch APIs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, Migicovsky&rsquo;s blog post reminds us about the challenges companies face when trying to compete with Apple in the smartwatch world. Apple&rsquo;s rules create an unfair situation, which limits choices for us and could be slowing down new ideas in wearable tech. As a user, I&rsquo;ve personally experienced this frustration. I once bought a non-Apple pair of earbuds, excited about their features and price point. However, I soon realized that the integration with my iPhone was clunky at best. Features like quick pairing and seamless switching between devices, which worked flawlessly with AirPods, were either absent or unreliable. I found myself regretting my purchase and, ultimately, giving in to the allure of the Apple ecosystem by purchasing AirPods. This experience, multiplied across various product categories, has led me down the path of least resistance, which is often the most expensive one. I&rsquo;ve gradually replaced many of my devices with Apple products, not necessarily because they were the absolute best in their category, but because they offered the most cohesive and hassle-free experience within the Apple ecosystem. This convenience, however, comes at a cost – both financially and in terms of the freedom to choose the best hardware for my needs, regardless of brand. Everything is good inside of the Apple walled garden, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">until it’s not</a>.</p>

			 <p>I want to break down this interesting comment from a Google employee about the upcoming Linux terminal on Android.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main purpose of this Linux terminal feature is to bring more apps (Linux apps/tools/games) into Android, but NOT to bring yet another desktop environment. Android, as speculated by the public, will have better desktop-class windowing system. We think it would in general be bad to present multiple options for the window management on a single device. Ideally, when in the desktop window mode, Linux apps shall be rendered on windows just like with other native Android apps.</p>
<p>This however doesn&rsquo;t mean that we prohibit the installation of any Linux desktop management system (xfce, gnome, etc.) in the VM. I just mean that those won&rsquo;t be provided as the default experience as you would expect. But, because Android is an open-source project, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if there will be any device maker who ships such a Linux desktop management system by default.</p>
<p>And GPU acceleration is something we are preparing for the next release. Stay tuned! :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a long-time ChromeOS user myself, I&rsquo;m personally buzzing with excitement, because this isn&rsquo;t just about a command line; it&rsquo;s a potential paradigm shift for Android&rsquo;s capabilities. What exactly are we talking about? You can find more background details about this upcoming terminal in this <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-linux-terminal-purpose-3535765/">Android Authority article from THE <strong>Mishaal Rahman</strong></a>. Seriously, stop reading this and go read that and come back.</p>
<p>The key takeaway is right in the first line: <strong>&ldquo;The main purpose of this Linux terminal feature is to bring more apps (Linux apps/tools/games) into Android, but NOT to bring yet another desktop environment.&quot;</strong> Think of it like this: Google isn&rsquo;t trying to turn your phone into a full-blown Linux desktop in your pocket (at least, not directly). They&rsquo;re aiming to unlock a vast library of existing Linux software and make it available to Android users. Imagine running powerful command-line tools, niche utilities, or even Linux-exclusive games directly on your Android device. But the implications run deeper than just running a few extra apps.</p>
<p>The comment then dips into the &ldquo;windowing system&rdquo; on Android and what that should look like. The Google employee says Android should have a better desktop class windowing system. Essentially, if you&rsquo;re using Android in a desktop mode (think plugged into a monitor, with a keyboard and mouse), Linux apps will behave like native Android apps, fitting seamlessly into the existing window management system. This tells us a few things: Google is definitely thinking about desktop mode on Android, and they&rsquo;re prioritizing a consistent user experience. This brings us to Google&rsquo;s official position.</p>
<p>The next section is crucial: <strong>&rdquo;&hellip;those won&rsquo;t be provided as the default experience as you would expect. But, because Android is an open-source project, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if there will be any device maker who ships such a Linux desktop management system by default.&quot;</strong> This is Google walking a tightrope. They&rsquo;re not officially supporting a full Linux desktop environment (like XFCE or Gnome) out-of-the-box. They&rsquo;re leaving the door wide open for device manufacturers (like Samsung, Xiaomi, etc.) to build their own implementations on top of the foundation they&rsquo;re providing, setting the stage for innovation.</p>
<p>If you want a true Linux desktop experience on your Android device, you probably won&rsquo;t get it straight from Google, but expect some clever companies shipping devices with custom Android builds that integrate a full desktop environment. If this sounds familiar, it&rsquo;s because this strategy mirrors Google&rsquo;s approach to integrating Linux into ChromeOS. Chromebooks have had Linux support (via a container called Crostini) for years, and the experience is remarkably similar to what the Google employee is describing for Android.</p>
<p>On ChromeOS, Linux applications run in a container and are displayed as regular windows alongside Chrome apps. The underlying Linux environment is there, accessible via the terminal, but it&rsquo;s not the default user experience. ChromeOS retains its primary focus, while Linux provides a powerful expansion of its capabilities. This is a good thing for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>The ChromeOS implementation has been largely successful, and applying that experience to Android is a smart move. A proven model helps with everything from security and isolation to minimal impact on the core OS, and finally flexibility. All of these things lead to the most exciting tidbit.</p>
<p>The final, and arguably most exciting, tidbit: <strong>&ldquo;And GPU acceleration is something we are preparing for the next release. Stay tuned! :)&quot;</strong> This means that Linux apps running on Android will be able to leverage the device&rsquo;s GPU for improved performance. Think smoother graphics, faster processing, and the possibility of running more demanding applications and even gaming. GPU acceleration is available for Crostini on ChromeOS and has massively improved the performance and usability of Linux apps that require them. What does this actually mean for users?</p>
<p>Based on my own ChromeOS experience, Linux apps that are likely to be game-changers on Android cover a few universes: <strong>Web Development Stacks, Code Editors, Image and Video Editors, Command-Line Tools, Retro Gaming Emulators</strong>.</p>
<p>Having these opened up on Android would be incredible. I can personally attest to the improved workflow that Linux applications on ChromeOS bring, but that is one part of what this upgrade can bring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s is incredibly exciting, but it also highlights the need for more powerful ARM-based hardware in both the Android and ChromeOS ecosystems. I&rsquo;m really hoping that chipmakers like Qualcomm start bringing their Snapdragon X Elite series of chips (or similar performance-class processors) to Chromebooks as well. Imagine a ChromeOS device with the performance and efficiency of those new ARM chips – it would be a true game-changer for running demanding Linux applications! The Snapdragon X Elite is showing so much potential on Windows, and it would be amazing if Chromebooks could leverage that same power. The more powerful the chip is in these devices, the better these apps will be!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to Android&rsquo;s Linux integration, and I&rsquo;m confident that it will unlock a whole new world of possibilities for mobile productivity and creativity.</p>

			 <h2 id="googles-daily-listen-your-discover-feed-now-in-audio">Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;Daily Listen&rdquo;: Your Discover Feed, Now in Audio</h2>
<p>Google is constantly experimenting with ways to make information more accessible and digestible. The latest foray into this arena comes in the form of &ldquo;Daily Listen,&rdquo; an experimental feature tucked away in Google Discover within Google&rsquo;s Search Labs. Imagine transforming your personalized Discover feed into a short, easily consumable audio podcast – that&rsquo;s the core concept behind Daily Listen.Here&rsquo;s a quick breakdown of &ldquo;What it is&rdquo;, &ldquo;How it works&rdquo;, and &ldquo;How Pixel customers can use it&rdquo;:* <strong>What it is:</strong>    * It&rsquo;s an AI-powered audio experience that provides a brief, roughly five-minute summary of the topics you&rsquo;re interested in, based directly on your Google Discover feed. Think of it as a personalized news bulletin curated by your own browsing habits.    * Essentially, it&rsquo;s an audio version of your Discover feed, perfect for catching up on the go, during your commute, or while multitasking. I&rsquo;ve personally found that these small, bite-sized, consumable podcasts are incredibly useful. Services like &ldquo;Daily Listen&rdquo; fulfill that niche of providing just enough information without the fluff that often bogs down longer-form content. Look at the success of podcasts like TechMeme Ride Home and even the long-running &ldquo;MacOS Ken&rdquo; - concise, informative briefings are a real win.* <strong>How it works:</strong>    * It uses AI to gather and summarize content from your Discover feed, creating a personalized podcast episode. The magic goes deeper than simple text-to-speech. The AI is likely leveraging techniques like:        * <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> To understand the core themes and key arguments within the articles in your feed.        * <strong>Summarization Algorithms:</strong> To condense longer articles into concise and digestible snippets, capturing the essence of the information.        * <strong>Topic Modeling:</strong> To identify recurring themes and group related content, ensuring the audio episode is coherent and well-structured.        * <strong>Voice Cloning or Text-to-Speech (TTS) with Style Transfer:</strong> Although not confirmed, it is possible Google is experimenting with using voice cloning to produce more natural sounding &ldquo;Daily Listen&rdquo; content, potentially with subtle inflections based on the tone of the original article. Another possibility is employing style transfer to adjust the TTS&rsquo;s pitch and tone for a more human-like reading, instead of a robotic one.    * The content selection is based on your search history and interactions with the Discover feed. This means the algorithm considers:        * <strong>Keywords in your searches:</strong> What you&rsquo;ve actively looked for provides explicit signals about your interests.        * <strong>Websites you frequently visit:</strong> If you&rsquo;re a regular reader of a particular news site or blog, content from that source is more likely to appear.        * <strong>Topics you&rsquo;ve engaged with in Discover:</strong> Articles you&rsquo;ve clicked on, shared, or saved are strong indicators of your preferences.        * <strong>Feedback you&rsquo;ve provided:</strong> Clicking &ldquo;More like this&rdquo; or &ldquo;Less like this&rdquo; on Discover cards directly influences future content recommendations.    * <strong>Technical Analysis Considerations:</strong> The back-end likely utilizes a combination of Google&rsquo;s existing AI infrastructure, possibly leveraging TensorFlow or similar frameworks. The system would need to continuously monitor and update your profile of interests in real-time, re-running the summarization and aggregation algorithms each time a new Daily Listen is generated. This necessitates significant computational power and optimized algorithms to deliver the five-minute summary efficiently. Furthermore, the system would require efficient caching mechanisms to prevent redundant processing for users with relatively stable browsing habits.* <strong>How Pixel customers can use it:</strong>    * First, users must opt-in to Search Labs within the Google app. Open the Google app, tap your profile picture, go to &ldquo;Settings,&rdquo; then &ldquo;Search Labs,&rdquo; and enable &ldquo;Daily Listen.&rdquo;    * Once enabled, a &ldquo;Daily Listen&rdquo; card will appear in the Discover feed. The appearance and frequency of this card may vary depending on the availability of relevant content and the algorithm&rsquo;s confidence in its relevance to your interests.    * Tapping the card generates the personalized audio episode. The AI then springs into action, compiling and narrating the audio summary.    * The user will then have audio control functions, such as pause, rewind, and fast forward, allowing for a user-friendly and adaptable listening experience.<strong>Daily Listen and the Potential Connection to Notebook LM:</strong>While not explicitly stated, it&rsquo;s intriguing to consider the potential relationship between Daily Listen and Google&rsquo;s Notebook LM (formerly Project Tailwind). Notebook LM is Google&rsquo;s AI-powered note-taking tool that summarizes, analyzes, and generates insights from uploaded documents. The core summarization technology powering Daily Listen could be a direct application, or at least a close relative, of the same AI models used in Notebook LM.Here&rsquo;s why:* <strong>Shared Summarization Capabilities:</strong> Both Daily Listen and Notebook LM rely heavily on AI-powered summarization. The same algorithms that condense lengthy research papers in Notebook LM could be adapted to summarize news articles in Daily Listen.* <strong>Understanding Context and Theme:</strong> Notebook LM is designed to understand the context and key themes within complex documents. This understanding is crucial for creating accurate and informative summaries, a skill directly applicable to the Daily Listen feature.* <strong>Potential for Personalized Learning:</strong> Imagine a future where you can upload your own articles, research papers, or meeting notes to Notebook LM, then have Daily Listen create a personalized audio summary of <em>your</em> content. This could be a powerful tool for learning, staying organized, and retaining information.Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;Daily Listen&rdquo; is more than just a fun experimental feature; it represents a powerful application of AI to personalize information consumption. Still in its early stages, the underlying technology, potentially connected to advancements in tools like Notebook LM, suggests a future where AI-powered audio summaries become a commonplace way to stay informed and engaged.<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/bedc0f97a4.jpg" alt="A smartphone displays a Google search screen with various widgets and app icons, including a Daily Listen" widget highlighted by a red arrow."></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Presenter</strong>: This is a live demo, on my Pixel 9. I need to pick my mom up at the airport and she sent me an email with her flight information. <em>[Invokes Gemini on phone in hand&hellip;]</em> Gemini, when is my mom’s flight landing?</p>
<p><strong>Gemini</strong>: Your mom’s flight is on time, and arriving at SFO at 11:30.</p>
<p><strong>Presenter</strong>: I don’t always remember to add things to my calendar, and so I love that Gemini can help me keep track of plans that I’ve made in casual conversation, like this lunch reservation my mom mentioned in a text. <em>[Invokes Gemini&hellip;]</em> What’s our lunch plan?</p>
<p><strong>Gemini</strong>: You’re having lunch at Waterbar at 12:30.</p>
<p><strong>Presenter</strong>: How long will it take us to get there from the airport?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People have been laying it on thick on Apple for their massive misstep of Apple Intelligence marketing a product that was never ready to sell another product. As John Gruber said in his blog post, Google should do a live demo of the exact thing that Apple said Siri would be able to do in front of a live audience in a live stream to truly prove that Gemini and Google Pixel are great products and a match made in tech heaven.</p>
<p>As John Gruber said, Apple just handed Google a potential marketing gift.</p>

			 <p>Honestly, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what Google&rsquo;s long-term plans were for Assistant. Given their history with sunsetting projects, there was a bit of skepticism. But then came Gemini, and the shift is happening. Let’s see how it unfolds.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-assistant-gemini-mobile/">Google said in a blog post</a> &lsquo;millions&rsquo; of users have transitioned to Gemini. While this is a positive sign, the scale within the broader Android user base is something to consider. The focus on &lsquo;most requested features&rsquo; like music and timers highlights the practical aspects of the update. The potential for &lsquo;free-flowing, multimodal conversations&rsquo; and &lsquo;deep research&rsquo; remains an area of interest. The introduction of features like Gemini 2.0 flash thinking and &lsquo;Memory&rsquo; adds to the evolving capabilities of the platform. AI development is complex, and balancing innovation with timely delivery is a challenge.</p>
<p>The AI revolution, sparked by OpenAI, has certainly changed the landscape. While Apple has hinted at contextually intelligent assistants and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">fumbled so far</a>, <strong>Google&rsquo;s approach with Gemini 2.0, Android, and Gemini Nano suggests a comprehensive strategy.</strong> They have the AI capabilities, the software, and the hardware, which is a significant advantage.
The timeline for execution is a point of interest. Google&rsquo;s announcements at I/O, including Project Astra, initially suggested a year-end rollout. The current mid-year update indicates a delay. While delays are common in tech, timely execution is always preferred.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Google&rsquo;s move to replace Assistant with Gemini is a necessary step in the age of AI. They have the pieces, but the execution will determine their success. If they can deliver on the promise of a truly intelligent and helpful assistant, they could redefine how we interact with our devices. But if they stumble, they risk falling behind in a rapidly evolving market. The next few months will be crucial.</p>

			 <p>Thirteen years ago, as a GeekSquad Advanced Repair Agent, I saw Chromebooks for what they were: cheap, $200 laptops with a measly 16GB of storage. <em>Thin clients</em>, the IT crowd called them. I called them underwhelming. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/samsung-chromebook-series-5-review/#:~:text=You%20can%20do%20a%20lot%20of%20things%20with%20one%20of%20those%20(or%20a%20smartphone%2C%20an%20Android%20tablet%2C%20or%20iPad%20for%20that%20matter).%20Right%20now%2C%20though%2C%20there%20are%20just%20a%20lot%20of%20things%20you%20can%27t%20do%20with%20a%20Chromebook.">Many other&rsquo;s thought the same.</a> Back then, <a href="https://cloud.googleblog.com/2012/01/bringing-chromebooks-to-every-classroom.html?m=1">Google&rsquo;s cloud ambitions manifested as these bare-bones machines</a>—a far cry from the integrated ecosystems I was used to, dominated by Macs and PCs. I knew Google made Android and those software services—Search, Docs, Sheets, Slides—they were fine. But the big picture? I missed it. Google didn&rsquo;t <em>build</em> hardware like Apple did. To me, they were just… energy. Pure potential, no form. Steve Jobs said computers are a bicycle for the mind. Google was the kinetic energy pushing the bike, not the bike itself. In this analysis, I want to trace Google&rsquo;s evolution from that pure energy to a company building the bike, the road, the pedals—even the rider.</p>
<p>The shift in my perspective came when I grasped the consumer side of cloud computing—servers, racks, the whole &lsquo;someone else&rsquo;s computer&rsquo; spiel. Suddenly, Chromebooks started to make sense. <em>Cost-effective</em>, they said. <em>All the heavy lifting on Google&rsquo;s servers</em>, they said. Naïve as I was, I hadn&rsquo;t yet fully registered Google&rsquo;s underlying ad-driven empire, the <em>real</em> reason behind the Chromebook push. That revelation led me to a stint as a regional Chromebook rep. A role masquerading as tech, but really, it was sales with a side of jargon. The training retreat? Let&rsquo;s call it an indoctrination session. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEr4j8kgwOk">&lsquo;Moonshot Thinking&rsquo;</a> video from Google [X]—all inspiration, no product—was the hook. Suddenly, streaming movies and collaborative docs weren&rsquo;t just features, they were <em>visions</em>. &lsquo;Moonshot thinking,&rsquo; I told myself, swallowing the Kool-Aid. Cloud computing, in that moment, seemed revolutionary. I even had &lsquo;office hours&rsquo; with Docs project managers, peppering them with questions about real-time collaboration. &lsquo;What if someone pastes the same URL?&rsquo; I asked, probably driving them nuts. But I was hooked. Cloud computing, I thought, was the future—or so they wanted me to believe.</p>
<p>That journey, from wide-eyed newbie to… well, slightly less wide-eyed observer, has taught me one thing: Google&rsquo;s Achilles' heel is execution. They&rsquo;ve got the vision, the talent, the <em>sheer audacity</em>—but putting it all together? That&rsquo;s where they stumble. Only in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22864892/google-2022-ecosystem-android-chromebook-ces-features">the last three years</a> have they even <em>attempted</em> to wrangle their disparate hardware, software, cloud, and AI efforts into a coherent whole. Too little, too late? Perhaps. Look at the Pixel team: a frantic scramble to catch up, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/30/pixel-android-voluntary-exit-employees/">complete with a Jobsian purge of the &lsquo;unpassionate.'</a> Rick Osterloh, a charming and knowledgeable figurehead, no doubt—but is he a ruthless enough leader? <em>That&rsquo;s</em> the question. He&rsquo;s managed to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24133881/google-android-pixel-teams-reorg-rick-osterloh">corral the Platform and Services division</a>. Yet, the ecosystem still feels… scattered. The Pixel hardware, for all its promise, still reeks of a <a href="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/02/24/googles-pixels-are-apples-tvs.html">&lsquo;side project&rsquo;</a>—a lavish, expensive, and perpetually unfinished side project. The pieces are there, scattered across the table. Can Google finally assemble the puzzle, or will they forever be a company of impressive parts, but no cohesive whole?</p>
<p>After over a decade of observing Google&rsquo;s trajectory, certain patterns emerge. Chromebooks (bless their budget-friendly hearts), for instance, have settled comfortably into the budget lane: affordable laptops for grade schoolers and retirees. <em>Hardly</em> the &lsquo;sexy&rsquo; category Apple&rsquo;s M-series or those Windows CoPilot ARM machines occupy, <a href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-plus-google/">is it</a>? Google&rsquo;s Nest, meanwhile, <em>envisioned</em> ambient computing years ago. Yet,<a href="https://www.threads.net/@panospanay/post/DG1DrgAypzL?xmt=AQGzS9MJYFBSnLZhfQRrSs7yxSRdj2F7kUbefTchTVf86Q"> Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa+ seems to be delivering</a> on that promise while Google&rsquo;s vision gathers dust. And let&rsquo;s talk apps: Google&rsquo;s own, some of the most popular on both Android and iOS, often <em>perform better on iOS</em>. Yes, that&rsquo;s changing—slowly. And the messaging app graveyard? Overblown, some say. I say, try herding a family group chat through Google&rsquo;s ever-shifting messaging landscape. Musical chairs, indeed. But, credit where it&rsquo;s due, Google Messages is finally showing some long-term commitment. Perhaps the ghosts of Hangouts and Allo are finally resting in peace.</p>
<p>The long view, after thirteen years of observing Google&rsquo;s sprawling ambitions, reveals a complex picture: immense potential, yet a frustrating pattern of fragmented execution. They&rsquo;ve built impressive pieces—the AI, the cloud, the hardware—but the promised cohesive ecosystem has remained elusive. Whispers of &ldquo;Pixel Sense,&rdquo; Google&rsquo;s rumored answer to true AI integration, offer a glimmer of hope. (And let&rsquo;s be clear, these are <em>just</em> rumors—I&rsquo;m not grading on a curve here.) But, after years of watching disjointed efforts, I find myself cautiously optimistic about the direction Rick Osterloh (knowledgeable, and, some might say, charming) and his newly unified Platform and Services division are taking. There&rsquo;s a sense that, finally, the pieces might be coming together. The vision of a seamlessly integrated Google experience—hardware, software, AI, and cloud—is tantalizingly close. Will they finally deliver? Or will Google continue to be a company of impressive tech demos and unfulfilled promises? Time will tell. But for the first time in a long time, I&rsquo;m willing to entertain the possibility that Google might just pull it off.</p>

			 <p>Pixel 10 series leaks are here, brought us by <a href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1899460344457638318">@OnLeaks</a> on behalf of <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-pro">Android Headlines</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pixel 10 series will be the first to use the new Tensor G5 which is expected to be manufactured by TSMC. Google had previously been using Samsung Foundry to manufacture their chipsets for Pixel, and it showed. Google had problems with overheating, the processor was pretty slow, and the modem was bad too. However, Google did fix the modem and mostly fixed the overheating issues with the Tensor G4 on the Pixel 9 series.</p>
<p>We are expecting some big gains in terms of performance on the Tensor G5, however, we also have to keep in mind that this chipset is being built specifically for the Pixel. Google is going to prefer AI performance over raw performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Tensor G5 seems to be the main focus on the Pixel 10 this year. Since the external design doesn&rsquo;t seem to be changing much, besides adding an additional speaker grill to the bottom of the device shown in the CAD renders, internal hardware, performance, and software could be where we get the most refinement. I&rsquo;m perfectly fine with Google not changing the design this year. If the Pixel 9 is the design they&rsquo;ll sit on for a couple of year (read as 3), I&rsquo;m happy with that. Pixel 9 series is beautiful.</p>
<p>However, I had a conversation with one of my IRL friends about <a href="https://www.threads.net/robklacy/post/DHHAWnNSiKm?xmt=AQGzSgmLtF1q5hoMEPSEFLXa5SYNhtPImdRF9UTqBAwacA">some nice things Google should add</a> to the Pixel 10. I&rsquo;d welcome all of them as long as it doesn&rsquo;t raise the price by much. Maybe $50 would let me depart with my hard-earned money. Anything north of that, I might be holding onto my Pixel 9 Pro.</p>

			 <p>A fellow Pixel Superfan had a great experience at the Oakbrook Google Store and he thought he&rsquo;d share:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just thought it worth sharing, my mom&rsquo;s <code>Pixel 7a</code> was having battery issues, I did a chat with support where they told me it wasn&rsquo;t under warranty, went to the store and they did a special warranty replacement given the battery issues that you can find all over the web. 2 hrs later resolved. Especially great considering she got this phone on my family&rsquo;s <code>Fi</code> plan with a promo that is still on going for <code>2yrs</code>.</p>
<p>While there they also fixed my charging issue on my <code>Pixel 5</code> by using effectively a dentist/surgical pick to pull the pile of lint out.</p>
<p>Just thought the good service was worth sharing with the community. ❤️</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice hearing success stories like this. Especially when the Google Store employees go above and beyond what is even asked of them. I hear this happens a lot. It makes people want to go into the store&rsquo;s instead of dealing with a contractor online. Still, Google&rsquo;s been doing a much better job at resolving issues at third-party repair shops as well.</p>

			 <p>Reports are that Apple is bringing a radically new design to iOS with iOS 19.</p>
<p>Mark Gurman, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/apple-readies-dramatic-design-overhauls-for-ios-19-ipados-19-and-macos-16">on Bloomberg&rsquo;s Power Up</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The revamp — due later this year — will fundamentally change the look of the operating systems and make Apple’s various software platforms more consistent, according to people familiar with the effort. That includes updating the style of icons, menus, apps, windows and system buttons.</p>
<p>As part of the push, the company is working to simplify the way users navigate and control their devices, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the project hasn’t been announced. The design is loosely based on the Vision Pro’s software&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Designer <a href="https://www.threads.net/@elimatthewjohnson">Eli Johnson</a> made <a href="https://iosvisionos.framer.website/">a brilliant concept of what that iOS redesign</a> could look like based off of the design of the current Apple Photos, Sports, and Invites app that was recently released. Even Jon Prosser, popular Apple leaker, on Front Page Tech <a href="https://youtu.be/HaP_q9W3AQE?si=cwRhHuyA-2ucP2dS">leaked a vision</a> of what he saw as the new Camera app design on iOS 19.</p>
<p>Personally, I welcome it and I&rsquo;m looking forward to this new era of UI from Apple because it&rsquo;s a long time coming.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve been working on my own app for Android, I&rsquo;ve been paying more attention to the front end app designs. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not a surprise, but though I do like Apple&rsquo;s new glass-like visionOS and what Apple plans to do with their OSes across the Apple space, I&rsquo;ve realized how much I enjoy Google&rsquo;s joyful and human Material Design.</p>

<p>Aside from material design not compromising form or function, it just feels more joyful and human to use compared to Apple&rsquo;s more cold, yet utopian sci-fi leaning design.</p>

			 <p>It seems Apple&rsquo;s AI woes continue.  Just when we thought things couldn&rsquo;t get more embarrassing than delaying &ldquo;Apple Intelligence,&rdquo; we get this gem. <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/114127816716893319"> John Gruber, over on Mastodon,</a> shared a screenshot of his recent conversation with Siri, and let&rsquo;s just say it&rsquo;s not a good look:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MacOS 15.3.1. Asked Siri “How do you turn off suggestions in Messages?”</p>
<p>Siri responds with instructions that:</p>
<p>(a) Tell me to go to a System Settings panel that doesn&rsquo;t exist. There is no “Siri &amp; Spotlight”. There is “Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri&quot; and a separate one for “Spotlight”.</p>
<p>(b) Are for Mail, not Messages, even though I asked about Messages, and Siri&rsquo;s own response starts with “To turn off Siri suggestions in Messages”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gruber simply asked Siri how to turn off suggestions in Messages on his MacOS 15.3.1.  Siri, in its infinite wisdom, first sent him on a wild goose chase to a non-existent &ldquo;Siri &amp; Spotlight&rdquo; panel in System Settings.  Then, it proceeded to give him instructions for <em>Mail</em>, not Messages!</p>
<p>This is beyond a simple bug; it&rsquo;s a fundamental failure in understanding basic user requests.  And remember, this is the same Siri that Apple wants us to believe is the foundation for their upcoming &ldquo;Apple Intelligence&rdquo; revolution.</p>
<p>Gruber himself pointed out the irony, highlighting how Apple touted &ldquo;product knowledge&rdquo; as a key feature of their AI, yet Siri can&rsquo;t even navigate its own settings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Product knowledge” is one of the Apple Intelligence Siri features that, in its statement yesterday, Apple touted as a success. But what I asked here is a very simple question, about an Apple Intelligence feature in one of Apple&rsquo;s most-used apps, and it turns out Siri doesn&rsquo;t even know the names of its own settings panels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s becoming increasingly clear that Apple&rsquo;s AI ambitions have outpaced their reality.  This latest Siri stumble, coupled with the<a href="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/03/07/mark-gurman-exposes-apple-intelligence.html"> &ldquo;Apple Intelligence&rdquo; delay</a>, paints a picture of a company struggling to keep up in the AI race.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s time for Apple to take a step back, focus on getting the basics right, and then, maybe then, they can start talking about revolutionizing our AI experience.</p>

		<a href="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/03/08/blueskys-at-protocol-roadmap-enhanced.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-03-08 01:20:14 -0700">Mar 8, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/2025-protocol-roadmap-spring">Bluesky has just unveiled its 2025 roadmap for the AT Protocol</a>, outlining some pretty significant changes aimed at making the platform smoother and more secure. Essentially, they&rsquo;re fine-tuning the entire system. A key focus is on streamlining data synchronization with the Sync v1.1 update, which will make running relays more efficient and clarify the process for validating the firehose. Think of it as optimizing the backbone of the network, ensuring everything runs smoothly. As someone who&rsquo;s been exploring both AT Protocol and ActivityPub clients, I&rsquo;m particularly interested in seeing how these improvements will help bridge the gap towards a truly functional fediverse. Currently, ActivityPub boasts a larger ecosystem of clients and more established connectivity.</p>
<p>Security is also a major priority, with the introduction of Auth Scopes. This feature will give users much more granular control over app permissions. For example, you’ll be able to allow an app to read your posts without granting access to your direct messages. It’s about putting you firmly in the driver&rsquo;s seat when it comes to your data. Developers are getting some love too, with a new web interface for PDS account management. This will simplify the process of building apps on the AT Protocol, making it easier for new users to sign up and manage their accounts.</p>
<p>Bluesky is also prioritizing the development of features for <strong>private groups</strong> and <strong>encrypted messages</strong>. They’re aiming to enable users to share content with specific audiences and keep it truly private, addressing a major demand for enhanced privacy. They’re also cleaning up the protocol by deprecating older features, ensuring everyone is using the latest and most efficient tools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe that robust support for group-private data will be necessary for the long-term success of the protocol (and for apps built on the protocol). Similarly, the ability to share private content with a specific group or audience continues to be a top feature request for both the AT Protocol and the Bluesky app. Just as we’re currently doing with public conversation on the Bluesky app and the AT Protocol, we also want to co-design the protocol specification for private data in tandem with specific real-world product features: this results in better outcomes for both. Designing for privacy is pretty different from designing for global broadcast, and we think the data architecture will probably look pretty different from the MST + firehose system.</p>
<p>Shared data will depend on Auth Scopes, and we don&rsquo;t expect to start design work until that is complete.</p>
<p>Looking forward, we continue to have plans to implement on-protocol DMs and E2EE group chat. However, we don’t expect to start work on this until after shared data is implemented. Meanwhile, there has been exciting progress in the broader tech world around the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) standard, and we are optimistic that we will be able to build on reusable components and design patterns when the time comes. It is also possible (and exciting!) that the atproto dev community will experiment and build E2EE chat apps off-protocol before there is an official specification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The AT Protocol community continues to grow rapidly, and Bluesky encourages everyone to get involved through GitHub discussions and community events. It’s a collaborative effort, and the company is clearly committed to building a robust and user-friendly decentralized social network. I&rsquo;m keen to see if these updates will allow the AT Protocol to catch up to ActivityPub&rsquo;s current strengths in client diversity and network connectivity.</p>

			 <p>If I had purchased the iPhone 16 like I had planned on after seeing what Apple teased with Apple Intelligence at WWDC 2024, I&rsquo;d be furious.<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-07/apple-confirms-delay-of-ai-infused-personalized-siri-assistant?srnd=undefined&amp;sref=9hGJlFio"> Mark Gurman has the scoop on Apple&rsquo;s upgraded Siri experience</a> and it&rsquo;s not good:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Apple Inc.’s turmoil in its AI division reached new heights on Friday, with the company delaying promised updates to the Siri digital assistant for the foreseeable future.</em></p>
<p><em>Apple said that features introduced last June, including Siri’s ability to tap into a user’s personal information to answer queries and have more precise control over apps, will now be released sometime in “the coming year.” The iPhone maker hadn’t previously set a public deadline for the capabilities, but they were initially planned for the iOS 18.4 software update this April.</em></p>
<p><em>Bloomberg News reported on Feb. 14 that Apple was struggling to finish developing the features and the enhancements would be postponed until at least May — when iOS 18.5 is due to arrive. Since then, Apple engineers have been racing to fix a rash of bugs in the project. The work has been unsuccessful, according to people involved in the efforts, and they now believe the features won’t be released until next year at the earliest.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple has reached a new low. Expectations are high for Apple because they made their bed by showcasing such a future forward AI experience at their annual WWDC event last year. Honestly, as I wrote that, I realized that&rsquo;s not even the main issue. This is the main issue&hellip;</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Apple, with its &lsquo;crack marketing team&rsquo; as deemed by Craig Federighi, created this impressive ad. The problem? None of these features exist. The upgraded personal Siri, capable of providing helpful on-device information in a manner similar to Gemini or ChatGPT, is not yet available. I nearly purchased an iPhone 16, hoping this feature would be available by the end of 2024. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t, and I&rsquo;m sure many people, unaware of the feature&rsquo;s delay, purchased the iPhone 16 expecting these features. Apple is one of the few tech companies that can release a product with delayed features without widespread customer backlash on platforms like Reddit or device returns. Consumers invest significant money in these devices, and I believe they are beginning to realize Apple is not immune to such issues. I used to believe Apple would only announce features ready for immediate and complete delivery. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/apple-cancels-airpower-product-citing-inability-to-meet-its-high-standards-for-hardware/"> Fool me once</a>, shame on you; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-07/apple-confirms-delay-of-ai-infused-personalized-siri-assistant?srnd=undefined&amp;sref=9hGJlFio">fool me twice</a>, shame on me. This time, I avoided being fooled, thanks to <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1896250347838202153">Mark Gurman&rsquo;s reporting on Apple Intelligence</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;m glad I stuck with Team Pixel and I&rsquo;m looking forward to the continuation of Google&rsquo;s Gemini advancements and the rumored on-device (Apple Intelligence-esque) <a href="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/03/04/pixel-sense-googles-ondevice-ai.html">&ldquo;Pixel Sense&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pixie&rdquo;</a>.</p>

			 <p>You know, it&rsquo;s been really interesting to watch how Google&rsquo;s design has evolved over the years. They&rsquo;ve gone from playing it safe to really embracing their own unique style, and it&rsquo;s made a huge difference in how people experience their products. It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re constantly trying to find that sweet spot between form and function, and it&rsquo;s been quite a journey to watch. As<a href="https://www.cleverpodcast.com/blog/ep-89-ivy-ross"> Ivy Ross, Google&rsquo;s Head of Hardware Design, put it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;How do you translate the sentiment associated with Google—human, optimistic, bold–into color, texture and form?&rsquo; That&rsquo;s exactly what they&rsquo;ve been doing, and I think it&rsquo;s really resonating with people.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, think about those early Pixel phones. They were fine, but they didn&rsquo;t exactly scream &ldquo;Google.&rdquo; But now, with the bold colors, playful accents, and those smooth, organic shapes, you can&rsquo;t mistake a Google product for anything else. And it&rsquo;s not just about the looks. Google&rsquo;s design is all about making technology feel more human, more approachable. Those fabric-covered Nest speakers? They&rsquo;re like a warm hug for your living room. The Pixel Watch, with its gentle curves and that water-droplet inspiration? It&rsquo;s like a natural extension of your wrist. And don&rsquo;t even get me started on the Pixel Buds case – it&rsquo;s so satisfying to hold, like a perfectly smooth pebble.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing: Google isn&rsquo;t just following trends. While other companies are obsessed with making phones as thin as possible, Google&rsquo;s focused on making them as useful and enjoyable as possible. And you know what? It&rsquo;s working. The Pixel Pro and the Pixel Fold are proof that you don&rsquo;t have to sacrifice functionality for style. So what&rsquo;s next for Google&rsquo;s design? I think we&rsquo;ll see them continue to blur the lines between technology and everyday life, creating products that feel less like gadgets and more like natural extensions of ourselves.</p>
<p>And honestly, I can&rsquo;t wait to see what they come up with next. It&rsquo;s clear that Google is committed to creating technology that not only serves a purpose but also sparks joy and feels like a natural extension of our lives. That&rsquo;s a design philosophy I can definitely get behind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Stackable widgets are possible on some Android manufacturer&rsquo;s devices and this is something we are looking into for AOSP. We getting this request a lot. So stay tuned. We aren&rsquo;t committed to this yet, but keep asking and we&rsquo;ll work on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OnePlus and Samsung are the Android manufacturer&rsquo;s that André was mainly referring to, but there are many more across the eastern hemisphere. Having it built directly into AOSP would not only make it available for Google Pixel, but it would free up Android developers from these manufacturers to work on other things. The pipeline seems to be that when things that were once only available on al specific manufacturer devices become available across all of Android, those same manufacturers find something else to be a catalyst differentiator among devices. It&rsquo;s a health progression.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using stackable widgets on my Pixel through the Smart Launcher and it&rsquo;s been pretty great. I can see the appeal, especially since the general philosophy over widgets is to be an app instance that does one thing really well instead of something that is a full window into the app. Though iOS birthed this new resurgence for widget design, Android continues to provide better functionality and practically on having widgets on the home screen.

I don&rsquo;t know why the Android team got rid of them, but they certainly brought them back in <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-qpr1-lock-screen-widgets-3481358/">Android 15</a> during the resurgence of Android tablets this past year. Samsung has been doing their own hops over the AOSP to support lock screen widgets on their own Galaxy devices, but with Android 16 right around the corner, Android as a whole will be getting the feature back again. Check out Mishaal&rsquo;s short video explaining how lock screen widgets will work on Android 16.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve started to notice this trend of slimming down smartphones. Samsung teased its next <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/a-near-complete-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-specs-list-has-leaked-pointing-to-an-even-slimmer-design-than-expected#:~:text=Slimmed%20down%2C%20at,were%20previously%20touted">Galaxy S25 &lsquo;Edge&rsquo; device that&rsquo;s going to be 5.84mm thin</a>. Apple is rumored to announce an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2025/01/13/apple-iphone-17-air-thinnest-ever-design-could-beat-expectations-new-leak-says/#:~:text=A%20new%20report%20by%20Ming%2DChi%20Kuo%20from%20TFI%20Securities%2C%20a%20hugely%20respected%20analyst%2C%20suggests%20that%20what%E2%80%99s%20called%20%E2%80%9Cthe%202H25%20ultra%2Dthin%20iPhone%2C%E2%80%9D%20could%20be%20a%20phone%20%E2%80%9Cwith%20the%20thinnest%20part%20around%205.5mm%2C%E2%80%9D%20according%20to%20Kuo.">iPhone 17 Air</a>, also allegedly known as the iPhone 17 Slim, to be around 5.5mm at its thinnest point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s apparent that innovation in the iPhone lineup has become stale, with Apple seemingly experimenting without a clear direction. From the iPhone Mini, Plus, and now Slim. And I&rsquo;m not surprised that Samsung is following suit as they usually follow Apple&rsquo;s lead with things. Google has won the GLOMO awards back-to-back with its Pixel Pro devices, and many would agree that their Pixel Fold is currently the best in the Western Hemisphere. Therefore, Google should continue focusing on tuning the hardware of that, continue to fine-tune Pixel Watch and WearOS to bring even more competition to the Apple Watch, continue to research the Android tablet market, drive demand for Android XR, and even put more R&amp;D on an <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-becoming-android-3500661/">Android tablet and laptops</a>. All of that sounds good. Google, do not waste your time on a Pixel Slim. Your Pixels are already sufficiently thin. If a breakthrough in battery slimming is achieved while maintaining capacity, simply incorporate additional batteries into the existing chassis.</p>

<p>Scam Detection for phone calls, powered by Gemini Nano, protects you from fraud with on-device AI while keeping your conversations private to you. This Pixel-exclusive feature detects conversation patterns in calls commonly used by scammers in real time and will notify you if it senses anything suspicious.</p>
<p>And Scam Detection is now available in Google Messages, too. It uses on-device AI to flag conversational text patterns commonly associated with scams, so it can identify messages that seem harmless, but turn dangerous over time. You’ll receive a real-time warning so you can easily block and report the conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My mom recently retired and if there&rsquo;s one thing that raises her stress level it&rsquo;s scammers. I bought her a Pixel 8a this last year, after having a Pixel 5 for some time, and she absolutely loves Call Screening and the Spam detection features in the phone app. Just the other day she sent me a screenshot of an E-ZPass texting scam that has been going around. She almost fell victim to it because E-ZPass is an actual highway toll system that is within her area. Thankfully, she didn&rsquo;t respond to it or click the link, but now that Scam Detection is coming to Google Messages, my mom will now get a large badge alerting her that this message was a Scam.</p>
<p><a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/03/new-ai-powered-scam-detection-features.html">More from the Google Online Security Blog:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scam Detection in Google Messages uses powerful Google AI to proactively address conversational scams by providing real-time detection even after initial messages are received. When the on-device AI detects a suspicious pattern in SMS, MMS, and RCS messages, users will now get a message warning of a likely scam with an option to dismiss or report and block the sender.</p>
<p>As part of the Spam Protection setting, Scam Detection on Google Messages is on by default and only applies to conversations with non-contacts. Your privacy is protected with Scam Detection in Google Messages, with all message processing remaining on-device. Your conversations remain private to you; if you choose to report a conversation to help reduce widespread spam, only sender details and recent messages with that sender are shared with Google and carriers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Scam Detection is only available in English in the U.S., U.K. and Canada and will expand to more countries soon.</em></p>
<p>Also, something I also found interesting is that <a href="https://www.leviathansecurity.com/">a cybersecurity firm</a>, conducted a funded evaluation of fraud protection features on a number of smartphones and found that<a href="https://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/2025-mobile-platform-fraud-prevention-assessment"> Android smartphones, led by the Pixel 9 Pro, scored highest</a> for built-in security features and anti-fraud efficacy.

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve only been using the Galaxy Watch Ultra for 4 days now. I really like the fluidity and battery life of it. However, I&rsquo;m beginning to feel like it&rsquo;s overkill for what I mainly use my smartwatch for. Maybe because I&rsquo;m coming from the thoughts of my experience with a Pixel Watch and an Apple Watch. The Galaxy Watch Ultra feels incredibly premium with so many useful features that I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll really use to justify and differentiate the reason to not just go back to my Pixel Watch 3. The display is beautiful and bright, the speed is warranted, and the build bolds confidence. Yet, the Pixel Watch 3 feels good enough to need the extra brightness, titanium build, and speed. I think if the Galaxy Watch Ultra was slightly smaller, like the <a href="https://www.hermes.com/us/en/product/hermes-h08-watch-42mm-W049430WW00/">Hermès H08</a> that it favors, I would feel more drawn to wear it as a lifestyle smartwatch.

<p>Kamila Wojciechowska at @AndroidAuthority gained access to a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-sense-3531570/?s=15">pretty hefty @GooglePixel leak</a> and it&rsquo;s everything I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to in a smartphone. Apple level privacy with Google level usefulness. From the sound of everything in the leak, it sounds like Google is looking to bring its version of Apple Intelligence to its Pixel 10, but calling it &ldquo;Pixel Sense&rdquo;. I absolutely love the name. Obviously it&rsquo;ll be powered by Gemini, but with it being completely on-device (🤯) and private, it sounds like Gemini Nano will be at the steering wheel, making all the data processing across all Google apps on Pixel 10 happen swiftly and privately on-device.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that the driving factor for this is speed, privacy is just the blessing result of on-device processing. A good example of this is Gboard&rsquo;s Assistant Voice typing and Proofread feature. At this point, Google already has a Scrooge McDuck level of user data locked up in an encrypted vault. It&rsquo;s now all about making your data more universally accessible to you. It sounds like the latest evolution of that is making our own personal data even more useful and quickly accessible to us. It sounds awfully similar to what Apple announced at WWDC'24, a whole year ago, that has yet to even be released on the latest iPhone 16 models. And rumor has it, by Mark Gurman, that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/622465/siris-real-ai-upgrade-could-still-be-years-away">iPhone won&rsquo;t even see that until 2027. </a>. Also something to consider is that this is something OpenAI won&rsquo;t be able to do anytime soon until they make their own hardware. Unless Apple, Samsung, or any other hardware makers decide to give OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT access to secure enclaves.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Online dating has become commonplace. For some Android users, the initial exchange of phone numbers or text messages can be a source of anxiety, as some Apple iPhone users, even in 2025, may hold prejudices against Android devices. When that infamous green bubble appears on an iPhone, some iPhone users are conditioned to disdain the sender, regardless of the prior conversation&rsquo;s quality or the individual&rsquo;s profile appeal. Gen Z members of my production team have explicitly stated that they would decline to date an individual solely based on their use of an Android phone, irrespective of other positive qualities.</p>
<p>This issue is largely confined to North America, prompting <a href="https://youtu.be/Iw-Yg7syOaM?si=2QwqQ0ZzKpuTOIXL">Google to enlist Keke Palmer</a> for a campaign addressing this prejudice during the recent Valentine&rsquo;s Day. The ad begins with a man preparing to respond to a &ldquo;Heyyyyy&rdquo; text from &ldquo;Sarah.&rdquo; The display clearly indicates &ldquo;RCS chat with Sarah&rdquo; and &ldquo;RCS Message,&rdquo; highlighting the use of Rich Communication Services. The ad emphasizes the ability to send reactions and high-resolution images, features previously unavailable between Android and iPhone. Notably, KeKe Palmer dismisses the man&rsquo;s concern about Sarah being an iPhone user being a problem with an eye roll, mirroring the sentiments of my Gen Z team members.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a peculiar dynamic, and Google&rsquo;s investment in educating consumers about the benefits of RCS is commendable. I wonder if Google might further amplify this message by showcasing couples like my wife and me, who found and maintain a loving relationship despite our differing phone preferences. My wife, an iPhone user, expresses a desire to switch to a Pixel, but is hindered by her iMessage group chats.</p>
<p>Perhaps this &ldquo;green bubble&rdquo; bias reveals a deeper societal issue: a tendency to judge others based on superficial technological choices. In a world increasingly reliant on digital connections, it&rsquo;s worth considering the limitations we inadvertently impose through brand loyalty and platform preferences. Google&rsquo;s campaign, while lighthearted, serves as a timely reminder to embrace inclusivity, even in our texting habits. After all, meaningful connections transcend the color of a chat bubble.</p>
<p>I hope that in the future, judging someone based on their phone choice will become as antiquated as using a rotary phone. I have to ask, are these ads working?</p>

			 <p><em>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t cannibalize yourself, someone else will&rdquo;</em> a saying I believe Steve Jobs said likely expressing his sentiment during the development of products like the iPhone, which cannibalized the iPod market.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/621353/microsoft-skype-shutting-down-retirement-may-2025">Tom Warren, from the Verge</a>:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Skype will be retired on May 5th, and existing users will need to export their data or migrate to Teams.</p>
<p>Microsoft will now be fully focused on Teams for consumers, after launching the personal version in 2020. At the time, Microsoft said it was still fully committed to Skype, but it’s been clear in recent years that the company was preparing for the eventual retirement of Skype. In December, Microsoft killed off Skype credits and phone numbers in favor of subscriptions, another sign that the end of Skype was nearing.</p>
<p>“Initially the vision was to have one experience across work and life… but Teams was new and that was not realistically where we were in 2020,” reveals Teper. “So we continued to invest in Skype, and about two to three years ago we started bringing in the free Teams consumer experience with the new client. We wanted to wait until the adoption was at the scale where we could be very convinced it was the right time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly the end of an era. Personally, I never used Skype as much as most people did. In fact, I believe at one point Skype was the number one video chatting experience that ushered in the Jetsons futuristic approach of communication. Skype had a head start, but during the pandemic didn&rsquo;t seem to be the go-to for people wanting to connect. That went to Zoom.</p>
<p>I still think Google Meet is in the best position to hold the spot for both consumer based and business based video based communication.</p>

<p>Google&rsquo;s latest retail venture lands in sunny Santa Monica, California, with an official launch date of March 7th,<a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/24/google-store-santa-monica-opening/"> as reported by 9to5Google</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;As teased at the end of Made by Google 2024 in August, a Google Store is coming to Santa Monica and will open Friday, March 7. This is Google’s sixth retail location and will be the second in California after Mountain View. It’s located at 1460 3rd Street Promenade, Santa Monica, CA 90401 and will open on Friday, March 7 at 10 a.m. PT.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this is the closest Google Store to me since moving from the East Coast, it&rsquo;s still a hefty 300+ miles away. This makes me wonder: Where&rsquo;s Google&rsquo;s ambition? Back in 2001, Apple boldly declared plans to open 50 stores in a single year. Apple proudly trumpeted this achievement i<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2002/11/25Apple-Opens-50th-Retail-Store-in-the-U-S/">n a newsroom press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;CUPERTINO, California—November 25, 2002—Apple® opened its 49th and 50th retail stores in the U.S. this weekend, with new store locations in Denver, Colorado and Emeryville, California. The Company now has stores in 24 states in the U.S., with a retail location within 15 miles of 85 million people, about one third of the U.S. population.&rdquo; - Apple Newsroom</p>
<p>&ldquo;We’re thrilled to have reached our 2002 goal of 50 retail stores in the U.S. in time for the holiday shopping season,” said Ron Johnson, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail. “Our stores are a great place to shop for hot holiday gifts like iMacs and iPods.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Six stores in four states in nearly five years? This sluggish pace suggests a stark contrast to <a href="https://youtu.be/OJtQeMHGrgc?si=ChDID4Gbsa5PCzPP">Steve Jobs&rsquo;s retail vision</a> back in 2001. Jobs understood that retail was about more than transactions; it was about education and experience. He envisioned Apple stores as hubs for learning about computers, the internet, and Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem. Google has the same opportunity.</p>
<p>Google Stores could be dynamic spaces for exploring ChromeOS, the power of AI, and the breadth of Google&rsquo;s offerings. In today&rsquo;s tech landscape, Google is uniquely positioned to lead in this space. Why, then, the hesitant rollout of just six stores in under five years?</p>

			 <p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/10/googles_pixel_8_event#fn1-2023-10-05">John Gruber made a really good analogy on how Google treats Pixel, their smartphone and Tablet hardware products. </a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Google treats its entire Pixel portfolio like Apple treats Apple TV hardware. They make the best parts of it available on other platforms, greatly reducing the perceived value of their own hardware. Why switch to a Pixel when almost all of Google’s apps are available on iOS? Why switch to an Apple TV box when the TV app and iTunes Store are built into your “smart” TV?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve understood for as long as owning a Google Nexus. I&rsquo;ve always wondered how Google approaches hardware development, especially given their lack of the kind of exclusive ecosystem that Apple cultivates. Even other Android OEMs have some unique features.  That just wasn&rsquo;t Google&rsquo;s culture in building its products. Google is synonymous with software, encompassing products like Search, YouTube, Gmail, and Android. We&rsquo;re nearing the 10th generation of the Google Pixel. <a href="https://x.com/lockheimer/status/779757830203068416">Hiroshi Lockheimer&rsquo;s prediction</a> that &ldquo;eight years from now we&rsquo;ll be talking about Oct 4, 2016&rdquo; has already passed. October 4th, the release date of the original Google Pixel, was what many, including myself, assumed he was referencing. However, it&rsquo;s now 2025, nearly ten years later, and Google&rsquo;s Pixel has only achieved a 4% market share, according to <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/post-insight-us-smartphone-sellin-down-4-yoy-in-q3-as-demand-remains-muted/">Counterpoint Research</a>. However, it still feels like gaining market share in their hardware isn&rsquo;t Google&rsquo;s main goal. News broke from 9to5Mac analyst Aaron Perris that <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1893058313316671627">Google&rsquo;s Gemini AI is coming to iOS</a> next to Siri in a future update. Echoing Gruber&rsquo;s analogy, this demonstrates Google making its key Pixel features available on other platforms.</p>
<p>I think Google needs to better articulate the value proposition of the Pixel to its existing customers, let alone attract new customers in carrier stores.  Perhaps a renewed focus on hardware exclusivity, or a clearer articulation of Pixel-specific benefits, is needed.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/pxl-20250222-032415097.jpg" alt="Auto-generated description: A hand is holding a light-colored smartphone with a G logo on the back, featuring a horizontal camera bar."></p>
<p>Having followed Google&rsquo;s Pixel line since its inception in 2016, from the original Pixel to the latest Pixel 9 Pro (and even the Pixel Fold), I&rsquo;ve developed a deep appreciation for Google&rsquo;s contributions to the smartphone market. My experience with iPhones (6, 6s, X, Xs, and 12) has further broadened my perspective. However, it&rsquo;s the budget Android segment, a significant portion of global smartphone sales, that truly captivates me. The Pixel 8a, initially released at $499 but now available for $300-$400 a year later, offers amazing value: a device promising six more years of feature updates.</p>
<p>The Pixel 8a immediately feels comfortable in hand. It&rsquo;s easy to handle, not prone to slipping, and not overly heavy or clunky. While it lacks the premium feel of my Pixel 9 Pro, it possesses a reassuring solidity. It&rsquo;s like a familiar, comforting tool. The matte back feels surprisingly sturdy, almost like a warm porcelain countertop. The buttons offer a satisfying &ldquo;click,&rdquo; though they betray the phone&rsquo;s budget origins slightly, lacking the springy resistance of a higher-end device. Even after a year of use, the click persists. Crucially, one-handed use is a breeze, even for my (slightly above average) sized hands; reaching all four corners of the screen is effortless. It&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;mini&rdquo; phone, but it disappears comfortably into a back pocket, sometimes even flipping around due to its manageable size.</p>
<p>The feel of a phone is paramount, as smartphones are deeply personal devices that perform a multitude of general and specialized tasks throughout our day. They need to feel approachable, relatable, and human – an extension of ourselves, not an interruption. The Pixel 8a achieves this beautifully, particularly with its matte finish and flat display. There&rsquo;s no awkwardness in holding it; the curvature simply settles into your hand. Unlike some flagship phones that scream &ldquo;luxury item,&rdquo; the 8a feels like a tool – one you appreciate more when you consciously focus on its thoughtful design.</p>
<p>I particularly appreciate the rounded edges, reminiscent of a perfectly smooth doorknob. The camera bar, while subtle, is a minor point of contention. It creates a slight disruption, particularly when the phone is in a case (even official Google cases), unlike the more integrated camera module of the Pixel 9 Pro. But the color options – especially the Bay and Aloe (though my wife prefers the Porcelain of our review unit) – are absolutely delightful. My main design quibble is the bezels. While not overly large, they are noticeable. I prefer a more minimalist approach, though I understand the need for some bezel.</p>
<p>The Pixel &ldquo;a&rdquo; series, following the pattern of the 3a after the 3, the 4a after the 4, and so on, continues with the 8a. It borrows heavily from the Pixel 8, with some compromises in camera hardware, display, and (in previous years) wireless charging. However, the line between the &ldquo;a&rdquo; series and the mainline Pixels is blurring, especially with price fluctuations. The 8a&rsquo;s $499 launch price often overlaps with discounted Pixel 8 prices, sometimes making the 8a seem redundant.  The Pixel 8a is, at its core, a budget-friendly Pixel 8. It retains the flagship-level software experience – the AI smarts, the Google Photos magic – but packages it in more affordable hardware.</p>
<p>In real-world use, the differences between the 8a, the 8, and even my 9 Pro are subtle but noticeable. Performance-wise, both share the Tensor G3 chip, so general usage feels snappy. However, the reduced RAM in the 8a becomes noticeable during processing-intensive tasks like Magic Editor edits, which take slightly longer. The camera compromises are most apparent in ultrawide (.5x) shots, where the 8a&rsquo;s limitations become clear. While not a &ldquo;camera hero,&rdquo; Google&rsquo;s AI processing delivers surprisingly good results, even compared to the 9 Pro&rsquo;s wide-angle lens.</p>
<p>The display is excellent for its price. While it struggles in direct sunlight, it&rsquo;s bright enough for most conditions. And the 120Hz refresh rate is a welcome addition, making the transition from my 9 Pro far less jarring than it could have been. Battery life is adequate. I found myself reaching for a charger sooner than usual, though my use of Pixel Stands mitigates this. The &ldquo;Limit to 80%&rdquo; battery optimization feature is a welcome addition for long-term battery health.</p>
<p>The under-display fingerprint sensor is fast and reliable. While not as instantaneous as the ultrasonic sensor on the 9 Pro, it&rsquo;s perfectly adequate for everyday use. And the software? This is where the 8a truly shines. A year after its release, Pixel Feature Drops continue to enhance the experience, bringing features typically reserved for the premium Pro models. With seven years of software support guaranteed, the 8a is a long-term investment.</p>
<p>The 8a comes in 128GB and 256GB storage options. I chose the 128GB version, relying on my 2TB Google One cloud storage and Google Photos. The display size is a sweet spot for me. It&rsquo;s not too small to be considered &ldquo;mini,&rdquo; nor so large that I need my Pixel Tablet. It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket. My wife, coming from an iPhone 13 Mini, finds it a significant upgrade in size and usability. The size and design make taking photos and videos easy. It&rsquo;s simple to pull the phone out of a pocket. However, the bezels, while not a major issue overall, become slightly distracting when composing shots with specific framing in mind.
The 8a&rsquo;s pricing is a bit confusing. Its $499 launch price often overlapped with discounted Pixel 8 prices, making the choice less clear. This underscores the need for potential buyers to compare prices and features between the 8a and the 8 (or consider waiting for the 9a). I helped my parents purchase their Pixel 8a phones, and they absolutely love them, capturing surprisingly good photos (even of a heron on their deck!) without needing to be photography experts or spend a fortune. This exemplifies the 8a&rsquo;s target audience: users who appreciate a good camera and a smooth Android experience without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>The main trade-offs with the 8a compared to the Pixel 8 are the camera sensor size (affecting light capture and detail), the RAM (impacting AI processing speed), and the more visible bezels. If these aren&rsquo;t deal-breakers, and the Pixel 8 isn&rsquo;t cheaper, the 8a is an excellent choice. The ideal Pixel 8a user wants a smooth, reliable Android experience with a great camera for the price, and values long-term software support. They might be upgrading from an older phone, seeking the best mid-range value, or prefer a smaller, more manageable device.</p>
<p>I recommend the Pixel 8a, especially given its continued software support, future feature drops, solid battery life, and affordable prices on platforms like Swappa. Even a year later, the software remains snappy, demonstrating Google&rsquo;s commitment to the &ldquo;a&rdquo; series. I&rsquo;m confident the Pixel 8a will age well, thanks to Google&rsquo;s seven-year update commitment and features like Battery Optimization. It&rsquo;s a phone that surpasses expectations for its size and price, delivering a surprisingly premium experience in a comfortable package.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Google counts India as a key growth market, where it has committed to investing $10 billion. It currently has only five physical stores, all in the United States, which sell its products such as Pixel phones, watches and earbuds.</p>
<p>It is aiming to mirror a retail approach that helped Apple Inc, opens new tab rake in billions of dollars in the last two decades by showcasing its own products. Apple has 500 plus stores worldwide.</p>
<p>Google is in advanced stages of finalising locations in or around the capital of New Delhi, and the financial capital Mumbai, said three sources, who declined to be named as the process is confidential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google&rsquo;s decision to open physical stores in India signals its ambition to increase its market share in the country. While specific sales figures for India are not readily available, Google&rsquo;s current market share in the premium smartphone segment is <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/03/google-pixel-india-premium-smartphone-market-report/">estimated to be around 5% as of 2024</a>. This represents a significant jump from the approximately 1% share it held in 2023.</p>
<p>This move into physical retail could be a game-changer for Google in India, allowing the company to showcase its products directly to consumers and build a stronger brand presence. It remains to be seen whether Google can replicate the success of Apple&rsquo;s retail strategy, but the company&rsquo;s investment in India suggests it is serious about making a mark in this rapidly growing market.</p>

			 <p>My cousin&rsquo;s sweet sixteen photoshoot was a special project, and I wanted to capture her unique spirit and personality.  Inspired by &ldquo;The Princess and the Frog,&rdquo; we explored whimsical poses and angles throughout Old Town Occoquan.</p>
<p>To achieve the desired effect, I relied heavily on the Pixel 8 Pro&rsquo;s versatile camera system. To highlight her expressions, I opted for the natural bokeh achieved through the phone&rsquo;s zoom capabilities (1x and 5-10x), avoiding the artificial look of Portrait mode. The Peaking feature was essential for precise manual focus on her face, ensuring sharp details amidst the whimsical movements.</p>
<p>Beyond focus, capturing the right mood and lighting was crucial. Using the Pro-mode controls, I adjusted shadows and brightness to highlight her features without compromising her natural complexion. The magic continued in post-processing with Google Photos.</p>
<p>The Magic Editor effortlessly removed distracting elements like trash cans and light posts, while a touch of vignette added a final touch of mystique, drawing attention to her captivating expressions..</p>

<p>This photoshoot was more than just a technical exercise; it was a chance to connect with my cousin and celebrate her transition into womanhood.  You can read more about the experience and what it meant to me on my <a href="https://blog.michaelbrownjr.xyz/2025/02/19/a-year-ago-my-first.html">personal blog</a>.</p>

		<a href="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/02/18/googles-safetycore-your-phones-new.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-02-18 13:06:09 -0700">Feb 18, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/c430fea1f1.jpg" alt="Auto-generated description: A smartphone screen displays the Google Play Store page for the Android System SafetyCore app, showing options to uninstall, details about its availability on more devices, user ratings, and the option to join the beta program."></p>
<p>So there has been a lot of online chatter about Google&rsquo;s newly released app called <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/5-new-protections-on-google-messages.html">Android System SafetyCore</a> that&rsquo;s being downloaded on a lot Android devices. Mostly Android 9+ devices. And there&rsquo;s been a lot of misinformation about it so I figured I&rsquo;d provide more <strong>correct</strong> information on the web about it. In short, it&rsquo;s like having a bouncer for your phone. <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/5-new-protections-on-google-messages.html">You can read the entire blog post from Google about it on their Security Blog</a>, but I&rsquo;ll try to explain in less detail. In short, Google lists the following new protections:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Enhances detection protects you from package delivery and job scams.</li>
<li>Intelligent warnings alert you about potentially dangerous links.</li>
<li>Controls to turn off messages from unknown international senders.</li>
<li>Sensitive Content Warnings give you control over seeing and sending images that may contain nudity.</li>
<li>More confirmation about who you&rsquo;re messaging.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So this bouncer uses AI to spot shady stuff like spam, scams, malware, and even those NSFW pics (yikes!) in your messages and apps. The best part? It does all this without snitching to Google or anyone else. Think of it like a super-smart security guard who can spot trouble without calling the cops. By not snitching to Google or anyone else or calling the cops, it&rsquo;s not sending your information to anyone. <strong>ANYONE</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, some people have been mistakenly thinking, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this like that client-side scanning thing Apple tried to pull?&rdquo; Nah, not even close. That was all about scanning your pics and <strong>reporting</strong> potentially illegal stuff, which was a major privacy no-no.</p>
<p>Android&rsquo;s SafetyCore is different. It keeps everything on your phone and doesn&rsquo;t share anything with anyone. It&rsquo;s more like Apple&rsquo;s Communication Safety feature in iMessage, which warns kids about sensitive content but doesn&rsquo;t share anything with Apple.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, like I said, <a href="https://www.threads.net/mx.twitch/post/DGLwlHjT8oP?xmt=AQGzUsce7b-QIBKJFL80bCxQmwUvY_uU2zn6GZF2iI_mqw">there&rsquo;s been some misinformation</a> floating around about SafetyCore, with some folks calling it &ldquo;spyware.&rdquo;  But that&rsquo;s simply not true. As the privacy-focused folks at <a href="https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1888280836426084502?mx=2">GrapheneOS put it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The app doesn&rsquo;t provide client-side scanning used to report things to Google or anyone else. It provides on-device machine learning models usable by applications to classify content as being spam, scams, malware, etc. This allows apps to check content locally without sharing it with a service and mark it with warnings for users.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The GrapheneOS team are experts in this field, and they clearly state that <strong>SafetyCore doesn&rsquo;t share your data</strong>.  So, you can rest assured that your privacy is protected.</p>
<p>The GrapheneOS team does wish Google would make the whole thing open source, which would increase transparency and trust. I agree  with this too, but here&rsquo;s the thing: apps have been able to do this AI security stuff for a while now, but they usually send your data to their servers. <strong>SafetyCore keeps everything local, which is a big win for privacy.</strong></p>
<p>Okay, so circling back to that <em>&ldquo;not snitching to the cops&rdquo;</em> part: SafetyCore isn&rsquo;t about reporting illegal stuff to the authorities. It&rsquo;s simply about giving your phone the ability to spot potentially harmful stuff and give you a heads up. Remember that and take that how you will.</p>
<p>So, there you have it! The TL;DR is <strong>Google&rsquo;s Android System SafetyCore seems like a pretty sweet deal for boosting your phone&rsquo;s security and privacy</strong>. Don&rsquo;t let the misinformation scare you away from a potentially useful tool. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how it evolves and how other apps start using it.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://youtu.be/dXw2huXZS5c?si=4PdsTwi3X7ccJCJ1">Jason Howell had David Piece, from The Verge, on his podcast today to chat about memorable tech.</a> It got me wondering what was my most memorable tech.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t think of a single one that I&rsquo;d call memorable. Yea, I&rsquo;ve had some great smartphone experiences, but those are still fresh. After going through my mental Rolodex &ndash; even typing that makes me feel old &ndash; I was able to remember the Dell Inspiron e1405, my first personal laptop that I got for college in 2006. I loved it so much. The large (at the time) screen, sleek design, media controls on the front, and full Windows XP. &hellip;Just to refresh my memory of it, I had to look up the specs.  It&rsquo;s funny how these numbers can bring back a flood of memories.  Check out what this machine was packing back in 2006:</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This isn&rsquo;t my exact laptop. I pulled this image from Ars Technica. I&rsquo;m still digging around to see if I can find it. Once I find it, I&rsquo;ll definitely update this post. Either way, I have fond memories with this laptop. Not only was it my first personal computer, but it was the computer I took my first Computer Science courses at University of Mary Washington. The memories of being frustrated trying to set up Putty SSH client on this machine as a freshmen came rushing back as soon as I saw thought about this laptop. It ran smoothly, I just didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing then. When I should have been studying, I used this laptop as a gaming laptop, before I knew about gaming laptops. It was my first forray into MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) with <a href="https://g.co/kgs/5zdB3w7">The Matrix Online</a>. Easily one of my favorite games I&rsquo;ve ever played. I could go on and on about that game, but it was also my first experience with having an online community. From the forums, the chatrooms, and even podcasts. It was just an amazingly nerdy time. Just allow me to nerd out for a moment.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TYYXrKj1824" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Back to the laptop. If I remember correctly, I held onto this machine until 2011. Towards the end of my relationship with this lovely machine, I replaced the hard drive after years of heavy use. I installed Ubuntu OS, and even purchased a new battery from eBay to try to salvage it. After a couple of months of troubleshooting driver issues, the motherboard officially called it quits and made it&rsquo;s way tech heaven. It pushed through so much. Burning CDs, LimeWire, Skype Video calls, coding projects, online exams, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>Now I know how Jason Howell feels when he talks about his Commodore 64. If you can, check out his podcast and this conversation with David Pierce. It will definitely get you thinking about your old fond memories of technology.</p>

With that said, a friend of mine uploaded what could potentially be a creative series (I hope), but so far this short story is amazingly well written. I&rsquo;ve never known him for being a creative writer, but for this to be his first, I was thoroughly impressed. The scene setting is so good. Just read this small excerpt and be amazed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I attempt to reconnect to Quinn&rsquo;s model, but I only receive an error message: &ldquo;MODEL UNAVAILABLE. Contact DataHive™ support to speak with a Neurogenic AI specialist.&rdquo; No, thanks. This doesn&rsquo;t seem like a &ldquo;turn it off and on again&rdquo; type of situation. I remove my headset and sit in silence for what feels like only a few minutes, just staring off into space, a million thoughts and possibilities running through my head. When I snap out of it, I realize I have been sitting there for an hour.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s only a small piece of it, but it&rsquo;s so good. I recommend you read it. <a href="https://micro.blog/jcrabapple@dmv.community">@jcrabapple@dmv.community</a>, if you&rsquo;re reading this. You better turn this into a series, bro! 😁</p>

			 <p>I had a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@nature.loves.symmetry/post/DGED1AyypFk?xmt=AQGzpTrTwg-Br7uGD-chGNsmhRH9_xoPQbmk_w7eOjnXuw">good conversation with Ankit Gupta on Threads</a> where he brought up something interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the major issues Android faced early on while trying to compete with iPhone/iOS was build quality of Android phones. After a few years, Google finally decided to step up and partnered with some OEMs to manufacture their Nexus phones; even bought Motorola. Overall, I would argue that Google is still paying the price of not having good hardware manufacturers for Android at the get go.
The conversation started here but was really led by Google potentially doing the same thing with their self-driving technology with Waymo and not partnering with the right partners or better yet making their own car like Tesla and Rivian.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google&rsquo;s initial approach with Android seems to stem from a lack of hardware experience at a time when hardware was the primary focus. Google represents the progression and evolution of Microsoft&rsquo;s focus on software.  However, in today&rsquo;s information age, if Google had focused on hardware earlier and failed, would their brand recognition and hardware be stronger today? I think so.  Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m unsure if Android would have achieved its current scale with numerous OEMs if Google had solely controlled everything and prioritized its own hardware.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously a game of what-ifs, but maybe in an alternative universe, Google started the Pixel line before even the inception of Nexus. Which would not only help with the brand recognition in the long run, but would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23379105/pixel-nexus-visual-history-google-design-models#:~:text=The%20Nexus%20One%20is%20the%20phone%20that%20made%20Steve%20Jobs%E2%80%99%20blood%20boil.%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20going%20to%20destroy%20Android%2C%20because%20it%E2%80%99s%20a%20stolen%20product.%20I%E2%80%99m%20willing%20to%20go%20thermonuclear%20war%20on%20this%2C%E2%80%9D%20Jobs%20said%2C%20according%20to%20his%20biography%20by%20Walter%20Isaacson.">cause Steve Jobs to really pop a blood vessel</a>.</p>

			 <p>So, I had a realization about my phone..it&rsquo;s ALWAYS black. Thinking of breaking out of my comfort zone.</p>
<p>I wrote a blog post about my new color journey.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m Finally Embracing Colorful Tech</p>
<p>For years, I&rsquo;ve been a creature of habit when it comes to my tech.  Black phone, black watch, maybe a black case if I was feeling wild.  It&rsquo;s not that I dislike black – it&rsquo;s classic, sleek, and goes with everything. But lately, I&rsquo;ve been feeling&hellip;bored. Like my tech accessories are starting to look as dull as my winter wardrobe.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/0a3ab2f036.jpg" alt="Two hands are holding a black and a white Google Pixel phone on a white countertop."></p>
<p>Then, something happened. I was hanging out with my friend Rob, and we were admiring his white Pixel 9 Pro.  Side-by-side with my black one, it looked so fresh and modern!  Suddenly, I had a pang of phone envy.  Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m locked into my Verizon plan, so a spontaneous phone swap was out of the question. But it got me thinking&hellip;why do I always choose black?</p>
<p>I realized it&rsquo;s partly about convenience. Black matches everything, so I never have to worry about clashing colors.  But it&rsquo;s also about playing it safe.  Choosing a colorful phone feels like a commitment, like I&rsquo;m stuck with that color forever.  What if I get tired of it? What if it doesn&rsquo;t match my outfits? But you know what? I&rsquo;m ready to take a risk.  I&rsquo;m tired of blending in with the crowd. I want my tech to reflect my personality, my mood, my vibe.  And that means embracing color!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting small.  I&rsquo;m thinking of getting a few different watch bands in fun colors.  It&rsquo;s a small change, but it makes a big difference!  I can swap them out depending on my mood, or even match them to what I&rsquo;m wearing.  Maybe a bright green band for days I need a little extra energy, or a cool blue one for when I want to feel calm and focused.
And speaking of outfits, I realized I already incorporate color into my wardrobe for special occasions. If I&rsquo;m going to a Suns game, I&rsquo;ll piece together some orange.  If I&rsquo;m cheering on the Lakers, it&rsquo;s all about the purple and gold.  So why not do the same with my tech?  A yellow phone case to match a purple shirt?  A lime green watch band to complement my Suns gear?  It&rsquo;s all about having fun and expressing myself!</p>
<p>Now, I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. &ldquo;Michael, you&rsquo;re still rocking a black phone!&rdquo;  And you&rsquo;re right.  I&rsquo;ve still got payments to make on my Pixel 9 Pro.  But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t start planning for the future.  I&rsquo;m already eyeing those new Samsung Galaxy colors, and the next time I upgrade my Pixel, I&rsquo;m definitely going for something outside of black or white.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;ll be experimenting with colorful cases.  It&rsquo;s the perfect way to dip my toes into the world of color without taking the plunge.  Who knows, maybe I&rsquo;ll even get a white one, like Rob&rsquo;s!</p>

			 <p>YT TV subscribers might lose a whole lot of channels if Paramount and YouTube can&rsquo;t ink a deal that&rsquo;s beneficial to everyone. My guess is that Paramount wants to increase it&rsquo;s profits, which would probably increase the price of YouTube TV and cause customers to be upset at YouTube TV and unsubscribe</p>

			 <p>When I think of &ldquo;Ultra,&rdquo; I assume it&rsquo;s the top-tier product in a series. I expect a premium price and a premium experience. This reminds me of the Chromecast Ultra. Despite being 5x less than the price of the S25 Ultra, the upgraded tier from the regular $35 Chromecast gives an idea of what that &ldquo;Ultra&rdquo; separation brings: more features, higher quality, etc.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/604154/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-ai-screen-battery">Allison Johnson&rsquo;s review of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra for The Verge</a> paints a disappointing picture, further defining the &ldquo;Ultra&rdquo; space:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The S24 Ultra downgraded the 10x zoom to a 5x, which is just okay at 10x, despite Samsung’s claims it’s just as good. The S25 Ultra downgrades the smart stylus into a dumb one without Bluetooth connectivity and air control features. I wouldn’t have a problem with that if those things had been sacrificed for some other compelling feature. But I can’t see what’s been added, and at $1,299, this is one of the most expensive phones you can buy that doesn’t fold in half. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a damn good phone. But I think at that price, it’s fair to ask for just a little more.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should read the entire review. It suggests to me that Samsung, like Apple, has reached its current peak in smartphone hardware, and Google isn&rsquo;t far behind as its design language has matured. We&rsquo;re looking at peak smartphone design now. So much so that Samsung is now removing features that a small minority of people used. Perhaps this is related to potential tariffs, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another discussion.</p>
<p>A friend who originally pre-ordered the S25 Ultra, coming from the S24 Ultra, has had an entertaining journey.  Because there isn&rsquo;t an immediate difference between the two, he went back and forth with his purchase, taking his followers along for the ride.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/eee23a46c4.png" alt="A person expresses opinions about the Samsung S24 Ultra, suggesting possible improvements and sharing personal expectations."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/22c13ee773.png" alt="A user comments on Twitter about canceling their preorder for the S25U, citing discomfort with its design and feeling it is cheaper compared to the S24U."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/530b5dfad6.png" alt="A person shares their decision to re-preorder the S25 Ultra after considering it further, planning to use it for a few days with the option to return it if unsatisfied."></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/9d47c5a341.png" alt="A smartphone and a smartwatch with a colorful display are placed on a light surface."></p>
<p>As Rob put it, &ldquo;Could they (Samsung) have done a little more this year? Maybe a little.&rdquo; I think so too. However, with all the software, hardware, and AI features that come with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, it truly represents peak smartphone design, especially for the standard smartphone design. The real innovation in hardware comes with the Fold and Flip devices, something Samsung, Google, and OnePlus are pursuing while continuing to optimize and polish their standard form factor phones.</p>

			 <p>Many people online, myself included, were initially upset about the perceived removal of Black History Month and other culturally relevant days from Google Calendar. It seemed to some like this change reflected a broader societal shift away from diversity, equity, and inclusion. However, that wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a href="https://blog.google/feed/google-calendar-changes-cultural-moments/">Google had to say about the change</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Some years ago, the Calendar team started manually adding a broader set of moments in a wide number of countries around the world — things like cultural celebrations, teachers days and many more. We got feedback that many other events and countries were missing, and it just wasn’t feasible to put hundreds of moments in everyone’s calendars — so in mid-2024 we made the decision to simplify and show only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com. Contrary to some of the comments on social media, this was not something we did just this year.</p>
<p>Some important things to note:</p>
<p>Showing public holidays and national observances, rather than a broader set of moments, is consistent with other major online calendar providers. Google Calendar is also customizable, so users can more easily add important moments to their calendar.</p>
<p>As a company, we continue to celebrate and promote a variety of cultural moments across our products, visible to people everywhere — as you saw in the last few weeks with Black History Month and Lunar New Year.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I admit, I was duped by these headlines that caused my frustration.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/screenshot-20250213-074431.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Verge, specifically, was the first headline and article I read on the subject and I was infuriated. The Verge even made sure to make Google&rsquo;s clarification on the change as far under the fold and away from the reader&rsquo;s eyes as possible. The Verge&rsquo;s article emphasized the negative aspects of the change. Though I don&rsquo;t like it and Google is still doing things I&rsquo;m not 100% okay with, it&rsquo;s stuff like this that happens that frustrates me with The Verge sometimes. Ultimately, as a reader, I need to do a better job at not letting headlines get the best of me.</p>

			 <p>Right off the bat, the app requires an Apple ID for login, consistent with Apple&rsquo;s approach to most of their other apps, including their Apple Music approach on Android. While Apple will likely cite &ldquo;privacy&rdquo;  as the reason 🙄</p>
<p>A significant drawback is the absence of previously purchased Apple TV movies and shows within the app. This feels like a missed opportunity, perhaps intentionally left as an incentive for users to remain within Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem, even with Apple TV Plus now available on Android.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;About this app&rdquo; section on the Apps Play Store page says the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Watch exclusive shows and movies on Apple TV+ and stream live sports With the Apple TV app, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Watch exclusive, award-winning Apple Originals shows and movies on the streaming service Apple TV+. Enjoy thrilling dramas like Presumed Innocent and Bad Sisters, epic sci-fi like Silo and Severance, heartwarming comedies like Ted Lasso and Shrinking, and can&rsquo;t-miss blockbusters like Wolfs and The Gorge. New releases every week, always ad-free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also included with your Apple TV+ subscription is Friday Night Baseball, featuring two live MLB games every week throughout the regular season.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stream live soccer matches on MLS Season Pass, giving you access to the entire MLS regular season-including every time Lionel Messi takes the pitch-and each playoff and Leagues Cup clash, all with no blackouts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access the Apple TV app everywhere-it&rsquo;s on your favorite Apple and Android devices, streaming platforms, smart TVs, gaming consoles, and more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apple TV app makes watching TV easier:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Continue Watching helps you pick up where you left off seamlessly across all your devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add movies and shows to Watchlist to keep track of everything you want to watch later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stream it all over Wi-Fi or with a cellular connection, or download to watch offline. The availability of Apple TV features, Apple TV channels</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the limitation of not being able to access your library of movies and TV shows in the app, the app is generally well-designed. Even if it utilizes Apple&rsquo;s iOS design language rather than Material UI/UX. I&rsquo;m not surprised by that.</p>
<p>On Android, the interface feels intuitive. Overall, I guess it&rsquo;s fine app. One <strong>big</strong> glaring issue is that it doesn&rsquo;t support casting. Just about every movie and TV streaming app supports Cast. So that&rsquo;s stupid.</p>

			 <p>Google is doing the right thing by bringing all of the Android development features from phones to Android XR, and one big question developers had was about using the pass-through cameras on Android XR headsets. It appears they are, based on an recent email exchange that a VR developer, <a href="https://skarredghost.com/2025/02/07/android-xr-camera-access-2/#google_vignette">Skarred Ghost</a> had with a Google spokesperson, confirming  that Android XR developers will have access to camera functionalities. The spokesperson clarified that developers can utilize existing camera frames with user permission, similar to any other Android app. Specifically, developers can request access to the world-facing (rear) camera stream using <code>camera_id=0</code> and the selfie-camera (front) stream using <code>camera_id=1</code> through standard Android Camera APIs (Camera2 and CameraX). Access to the world-facing camera requires standard camera permissions, just like on phones. For the selfie-camera, developers receive an image stream of the user&rsquo;s avatar, generated by avatar provider apps/services based on user tracking data from inward-facing cameras. The spokesperson emphasized that Android developers can use the same camera management classes (like CameraX) on Android XR headsets as they do on phones, enabling functionalities like grabbing frames and videos, saving media, and running machine learning analysis.</p>
<p>This shows that Google and the Android team have not only learned from their time and experience with Android handsets, TVs, and wearables, but they have also created an ecosystem of developable tools that will allow developers to create one app for all platforms instead of separate apps for each platform. This is a significant advantage, creating a great experience for developers across many different platforms, especially when they utilize Jetpack libraries for a cohesive UI experience across Android hardware.</p>
<p>This move by Google signals a bright future for Android XR development. The unification of the platform, coupled with camera access, empowers developers and paves the way for a new generation of immersive experiences.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://io.google/2025/">Google I/O</a>, the annual developer conference, is set to take place at Shoreline on May 20-21st! Registration is currently open, and tickets are being distributed in phases. I&rsquo;ve already secured my badge for my fifth I/O event!</p>

<p>While the event schedule typically isn&rsquo;t released until a couple of weeks prior, I expect this year&rsquo;s I/O to be heavily focused on AI, offering developers new tools to improve their native and web applications. Last year, Gemini was unveiled piece by piece, showcasing its capabilities across Android, ChromeOS, and the Web.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.android.com/xr/">Android XR</a> will likely have a more prominent role this year, especially after the recent unveiling of its software and hardware at Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Unpacked event. I&rsquo;m particularly excited about <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/project-astra/">Project Astra</a> and the UI/UX for the Android XR glasses, which were teased earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Pixel will undoubtedly take center stage. The <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/11/google-pixel-9a-colors-camera-bar-leak/">Pixel 9a</a> should be released by then, and we might even get a sneak peek at the Pixel 10 series.  There have also been rumors about <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-laptop-development.html">Android making its way to laptops</a>, given that the ChromeOS and Android teams are now under the same Platform and Services department.</p>
<p>As you can see, there&rsquo;s a lot to look forward to at Google I/O.  AI will continue to be a central theme, and I&rsquo;m eager to see what innovations are unveiled.</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;re at a fascinating moment with Artificial Intelligence. It feels like everyone&rsquo;s talking about it, some with excitement, others with a bit of trepidation.  It reminds me of something Pharrell Williams said at the recent AI Summit in Paris:</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-in-the-90speople-were-genuinely-worried">&ldquo;The internet in the &rsquo;90s&hellip;people were genuinely worried.&rdquo;</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/359a186e66.jpg" alt="Three people are seated on stage, engaged in a panel discussion, with one person speaking into a microphone."></p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right. By doing a little research and seeing how people viewed the internet back then, I&rsquo;ve gotten a good understanding of just how worried many were. Some marveled at the instant access to information, while others worried about its impact. It&rsquo;s funny, isn&rsquo;t it? Fast forward to today, and it&rsquo;s hard to imagine life without it. We&rsquo;re at a similar inflection point with AI, and honestly, I think that&rsquo;s what makes events like the AI Summit in Paris so important. They bring together people from all over the world—researchers, tech companies, everyday consumers—and spark a global conversation about what AI can achieve.  This isn&rsquo;t about robots taking over; it&rsquo;s about AI becoming a powerful partner, accelerating human ingenuity and ushering in a new era of innovation. And this vision was echoed by Sundar Pichai, who emphasized the incredible potential of AI to address some of humanity&rsquo;s greatest challenges.</p>
<p>I think one of the biggest hurdles AI faces is perception. We&rsquo;ve all seen the movies—the iRobot antagonist, the Matrix scenarios—and it&rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of thinking AI is inherently malicious, destined to take our jobs and turn us into batteries. But like most things in life, there&rsquo;s a good side to this. Just like any tool, AI can be used for good or bad. And at the AI Summit, we saw so many examples of the <strong>good</strong> it can do.</p>
<p>AI isn&rsquo;t a sudden invention; it&rsquo;s the next logical step in our technological evolution. Just as we moved from basic computing to the internet, and then to mobile, AI is now poised to become ubiquitous. Imagine a &ldquo;universal AI assistant&rdquo; – seamlessly integrated into your Android phone, your Google Workspace, your smart home, and beyond. This is the vision behind concepts like &ldquo;Project Astra&rdquo;: AI that understands context, anticipates needs, and assists you across all aspects of your life. It&rsquo;s not just a feature; it&rsquo;s a fundamental shift in how we interact with technology.</p>
<p>AI&rsquo;s real magic? It&rsquo;s all about collaboration. And science is where we&rsquo;re seeing some truly mind-blowing breakthroughs. Consider AlphaFold, a super-smart AI from DeepMind, that can predict how proteins are shaped with incredible accuracy. Proteins are like the building blocks of life, and knowing their shape is key to understanding diseases and developing new treatments. Researchers estimate that AlphaFold has saved years of research time, not just days or weeks. Over a million researchers worldwide have used AlphaFold, accessing over 200 million protein structure predictions, accelerating research in areas from drug discovery to combating antibiotic resistance. Building on this success, Isomorphic Labs is using machine learning to revolutionize drug design, potentially shortening development timelines and creating more effective treatments. And we&rsquo;re just scratching the surface. The next big thing on the horizon? It&rsquo;s called Quantum Computing. Imagine regular computers as light bulbs—they can be on or off. Quantum computers are more like lasers—they can be on, off, <strong>and</strong> a whole bunch of other states in between. This gives them the potential to solve problems that are impossible for today&rsquo;s computers. Breakthroughs like Google&rsquo;s Willow quantum chip, with its improved coherence and control, promise to unlock computational power previously unimaginable. Collaborative efforts, like those with Servier in France, are pushing the boundaries of what&rsquo;s possible, exploring how quantum AI can solve complex problems in materials science, chemistry, and beyond.</p>
<p>AI isn&rsquo;t just changing science; it&rsquo;s changing the world around us, one innovation at a time. Waymo has already logged millions of passenger trips, proving that self-driving cars aren&rsquo;t just a futuristic dream—they&rsquo;re a present-day reality. This isn&rsquo;t just about convenience; it&rsquo;s about increasing road safety and accessibility. With 110 new languages added, Google Translate is tearing down communication barriers and building bridges of understanding across cultures. Imagine the impact on education, business, and personal connections. AI is also revolutionizing healthcare, from assisting in cancer research to improving diabetic retinopathy screening (which helps doctors detect eye diseases caused by diabetes). Partnerships like the one with Institute Curry, and work in India and Thailand, are leading to earlier diagnoses, more personalized treatments, and ultimately, better patient outcomes. AI-powered flood forecasts now cover 80 countries, and wildfire mapping provides crucial real-time information, helping communities prepare for and respond to natural disasters. These tools are saving lives and protecting livelihoods.  I was particularly struck by the stories shared at the AI Summit, like the one about Max using Gemini to learn about his son&rsquo;s rare disease.  It really brings home how AI can empower individuals and make a profound difference in people&rsquo;s lives.  It&rsquo;s stories like these that make the potential of AI so incredibly exciting.</p>
<h2 id="_we-are-at-the-dawn-of-a-golden-age-of-innovation_---sundar-pichai"><em>&ldquo;We are at the dawn of a golden age of innovation,&quot;</em> - <strong>Sundar Pichai</strong></h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/caeb10c065.jpg" alt="A person is speaking at a podium during the Summit of the Future&rdquo; event with a backdrop showing a cityscape and a presentation slide."></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be real: AI is powerful, and with great power comes great responsibility. Worries about bias, job displacement, and ethical implications are legitimate and must be addressed head-on. But just as we developed safeguards for other transformative technologies, we can – and must – do the same for AI. Responsible AI development is paramount. This means prioritizing fairness, transparency, and accountability. It means embedding ethical considerations into the very design of AI systems. Human oversight is crucial; AI should be a tool that augments human capabilities, not replaces them. Plus, we need to create an environment where innovation can thrive. This requires significant investment in infrastructure, like the billions Google is spending on data centers and AI development. It also means investing in people. Programs like &ldquo;Grow with Google&rdquo; and the Global AI Opportunity Fund, which have trained millions of people in digital skills, are essential to ensure that everyone can benefit from the AI revolution. We also need to be clear about AI&rsquo;s limitations. AI models can sometimes be inaccurate, they are vulnerable to misuse, and the computational power they require can have significant energy implications. We need to be honest about these challenges, take them seriously, and find ways to tackle them head-on. AI should be democratized, meaning access and benefits should be widely shared.</p>
<p>Governments have a strategic role to play in shaping the future of AI. We need aligned policy across countries, striking a delicate balance between mitigating risks and fostering innovation. Overly restrictive regulations could stifle progress, while a laissez-faire approach could lead to unintended consequences. The goal should be to create an environment where AI can flourish responsibly, benefiting all of humanity.</p>
<h2 id="_ai-is-a-profound-technology-and-its-important-that-we-develop-it-responsibly_---sundar-pichai"><em>&ldquo;AI is a profound technology, and it&rsquo;s important that we develop it responsibly,&quot;</em> - <strong>Sundar Pichai</strong>.</h2>
<p>Sundar Pichai, at the AI Summit, spoke eloquently about the &ldquo;once-in-a-generation opportunity&rdquo; that AI presents. We are at the dawn of a &ldquo;golden age of innovation,&rdquo; and the potential benefits are immense. But we can&rsquo;t afford to be complacent. Other nations are investing heavily in AI, and we risk falling behind if we don&rsquo;t act decisively.  Just like how people feared search engines would replace libraries in the &rsquo;90s (and they didn&rsquo;t—they just made information more accessible), I believe AI will augment, not replace, human capabilities.</p>
<p>Imagine a future where AI empowers us to not just solve, but <em>vanquish</em> the world&rsquo;s most pressing challenges – from climate change to disease, once and for all. Imagine a future where personalized education, accessible healthcare, and sustainable energy are available to all. This isn&rsquo;t just sci-fi anymore; it&rsquo;s a future within our reach, if we embrace the collaborative potential of human ingenuity and artificial intelligence.</p>

		<a href="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/02/11/youtube-is-the-new-television.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-02-11 07:49:47 -0700">Feb 11, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/our-big-bets-for-2025/">YouTube CEO Neal Mohan&rsquo;s recent blog post, &ldquo;Our Big Bets for 2025,&quot;</a> isn&rsquo;t just a corporate update; it&rsquo;s a super interesting peek into where online video and entertainment are headed.  It&rsquo;s pretty clear that YouTube isn&rsquo;t just along for the ride; they&rsquo;re trying to steer the whole darn thing. Let&rsquo;s break down what these &ldquo;big bets&rdquo; tell us about YouTube&rsquo;s plans and how they might affect, well, everyone.</p>
<p>Mohan&rsquo;s claim that &ldquo;YouTube is the epicenter of culture&rdquo; is spot on, right? From viral dances to breaking news, YouTube&rsquo;s fingerprints are all over what we watch, share, and talk about. It&rsquo;s become a massive cultural force, and I&rsquo;m excited to see how they double down on this in the future.  Imagine even cooler tools for spotting and boosting new trends, giving creators an even bigger stage to connect with their fans.</p>
<p>The <em>&ldquo;YouTubers are the new Hollywood startups&rdquo;</em> thing is a perfect example of how YouTube&rsquo;s empowered creators.  It&rsquo;s not just a hobby anymore; making YouTube videos is a real career, with creators building serious businesses and influencing millions of people.  YouTube getting this and supporting its creators is key.  More tools, resources, and ways to make money will only help this growth, creating a dynamic community of talent and innovation.</p>
<p>The <em>&ldquo;YouTube is the new television&rdquo;</em> narrative has been around for a while, but Mohan&rsquo;s emphasis shows just how much things have changed. With smart TVs everywhere, YouTube&rsquo;s a major player in our living rooms, going head-to-head with traditional TV. This changes everything, from ads and content to how we even define &ldquo;television.&rdquo; And speaking of the living room, let’s not forget YouTube Primetime!  Even though their own original shows might have missed the mark, offering live sports like NBA and WNBA games, plus other premium content, makes YouTube a one-stop shop for entertainment. Smart move.</p>
<p>The focus on AI is probably the most interesting <em>&ldquo;big bet.&quot;</em> AI&rsquo;s already a big part of YouTube&rsquo;s algorithms and how things work, but the future possibilities are mind-blowing. Think AI-powered video editing, automatic captions and translations making videos more accessible, and even AI-generated content (with some safety nets, hopefully). The potential is huge, and it could totally change how we make and watch videos.
Beyond the headlines, the blog post has some cool stats. YouTube&rsquo;s dominance in podcasts, for example, is surprising but also makes sense.  More podcast integration could be a game-changer for creators and listeners. And with more people watching YouTube on their TVs, YouTube&rsquo;s focus on connected TVs and better streaming is a smart move.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, YouTube&rsquo;s 2025 vision is ambitious and optimistic.  They&rsquo;re not just keeping up with change; they&rsquo;re trying to lead the way. By betting on creators, tech, and their role as a cultural hub, YouTube&rsquo;s setting itself up for a big future in media and entertainment.  It&rsquo;s going to be fun to watch what happens next. And hey, even the comments section is a whole lot better than it used to be, right?  (Okay, maybe not always.)</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/02/11/why-i-enjoy-my-pixel.html">Why I Enjoy My #Pixel (Even Though Everyone Has an iPhone)</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/02/11/why-i-enjoy-my-pixel.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-02-11 00:05:38 -0700">Feb 11, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was recently reminded of the perception that people with Android phones are seen as stubborn and non-conforming when someone asked me why I don&rsquo;t have an iPhone. This happened during an in-person conversation when I used my Pixel to reply to a text. The person simply asked why I didn&rsquo;t have an iPhone, and I replied that I prefer the phone I have. It seemed so unfamiliar to them. This experience echoed as I watched the Lakers game, noticing the sea of iPhones in the stands. It made me think about how the &ldquo;blue bubble&rdquo; of iMessage has become such a status symbol, even though I&rsquo;ve found my Android integrates perfectly with all the services I use daily.</p>
<p>I remember when I first switched to Android because of its customization options. I love being able to personalize my home screen with widgets and icon packs that reflect my style. It&rsquo;s not about being different; it&rsquo;s about having a phone that truly feels like mine. And the variety! There are so many different Android phones available, each with its own strengths. I chose my Pixel because of its camera and its smooth performance, but someone else might prefer a phone with a longer battery life or a larger screen. The point is, there&rsquo;s an Android phone out there for everyone.</p>
<p>But in the past five years, my preference for Pixel has solidified even further because of its seamless integration with cutting-edge AI. Platforms like Gemini and Perplexity, which are revolutionizing how we interact with technology, work so much better within the Android ecosystem, especially on Pixel devices. It&rsquo;s not just about the customization anymore; it&rsquo;s about having access to these powerful tools that enhance productivity and provide a truly intelligent mobile experience. This level of AI integration is a game-changer, and it&rsquo;s something I wouldn&rsquo;t want to sacrifice.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I almost switched to an iPhone myself this year. When I saw the announcements at WWDC and Apple unveiled Apple Intelligence, I was intrigued. I was almost ready to jump ship when the iPhone 16 came out. However, after the initial excitement subsided, I realized that Apple Intelligence wasn&rsquo;t quite the finished product it was presented as. It seemed like Apple was, and frankly still is, quite behind the competition in the AI space.  Almost a year later, and while they&rsquo;ve made some progress, Apple Intelligence still lags behind platforms like Gemini on Google Pixel and other Android devices.  This solidified my decision to stay with Android.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how we&rsquo;ve come to equate iPhones with &ldquo;normalcy.&rdquo; Apple&rsquo;s marketing has been incredibly effective, creating this image of the iPhone as the must-have device. But I think it&rsquo;s important to challenge that idea. Choosing Android isn&rsquo;t about being stubborn; it&rsquo;s about making an informed decision based on my needs and preferences. It&rsquo;s about appreciating the open-source nature of the Android ecosystem, which gives me more control over my device and access to a wider range of apps and these powerful AI platforms. And honestly, I&rsquo;ve never felt like I&rsquo;m missing out on anything. In fact, I often find myself appreciating the unique features and capabilities of my Android phone, especially its superior AI integration.</p>
<p>What about you? What made you choose your current phone? I&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts on the &ldquo;iPhone norm&rdquo; and why you prefer your device.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ll spare you into writing up another dissecting blog post, breaking down Kendrick Lamar&rsquo;s Superbowl halftime performance. I will <a href="https://time.com/7214228/kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show-analysis/">highlight Time Magazine&rsquo;s</a> since I think it&rsquo;s the best comprehensive breakdown review. In its conclusion  the writer says the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In its framing, narrative approach, and density, Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl was unlike any that have come before it. To some, it mystified; to others, it kicked open the door for what this format could be. Just because something is expected of you, he seemed to be saying, doesn’t mean that’s the path you should take. Maybe Kendrick, in his own words, does deserve it all.</p>

<p>Android users are familiar with being able to install APK files to access apps that aren&rsquo;t in the Google Play Store, though at times it could be risky. As some people like to make harmful APK files to jeopardize Android devices. The good thing is that Google uses Play Protect to protect and scan any applications that are installed on Android devices and alarm you if there&rsquo;s anything that could be potentially harmful, and that&rsquo;s even including apps that weren&rsquo;t installed from the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t be installing TikTok as I gave up my TikTok usage a few years ago, but for those that are still on The TikTok clock including the creators, this should be great for them.</p>

			 <p>Three things I love about the Super Bowl, like many others: the game, the halftime performance, and the ads. This year, my excitement peaked with the halftime performance, followed by the game, and then the ads. If you follow me on Mastodon and BlueSky, you&rsquo;ll see that about 90% of my posts focused on Kendrick Lamar&rsquo;s halftime performance, with 5% dedicated to the ads and the remaining 5% to the game. Congratulations, Eagles!</p>
<p>I was particularly interested in seeing how others received Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dream Job&rdquo; commercial, which I absolutely loved. I&rsquo;d rate it a &ldquo;B+,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ll explain why after sharing what others had to say. Here&rsquo;s the commercial:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/super-bowl-commercials-2025-grading-the-best-worst-wildest-and-weirdest-big-game-ads-180257494.html">Yahoo Sports</a> also gave the ad a &ldquo;B&rdquo; grade. Here&rsquo;s what they had to say about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Google using straight-up emotional terrorism to sell phones now, showing a young girl embracing her father as both a child and as a college student. Wicked, but effective.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I get it, but the point is to be effective and it really is. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/09/nx-s1-5273643/super-bowl-commercials-best-worst">NPR didn&rsquo;t dish out a grade, but they did a much better job explaining the complexity Google accomplished with this ad</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Typically, an AI, which sounds like a real person coaching you through a hypothetical job interview, might give off serious vibes like HAL 9000 (the killer computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey). But Google&rsquo;s ad features a father talking about his work experience to the Gemini Live AI chatbot — &ldquo;I show up every day, no matter what&rdquo; — while imagery reveals he&rsquo;s talking about raising his daughter. It adds up to an emotive, touching spot that emphasizes how people can use technology to perform better, rather than depicting a giant corporation offering software that encourages you to depend on them more as every year passes — seeing AI less as a job killer and more like a job search enabler. Hmmm.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/arts/television/super-bowl-commercials-ads-best-worst.html">New York Times</a> had this to say about Google&rsquo;s ad:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The national ad for Google’s Gemini personal assistant is likely to be the most slickly handsome production in the field. If the use of Capra-esque family moments to humanize an A.I.-generated voice that coaches a dad for a job interview completely creeps you out, however, feel free to move this to the bottom of the list.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oddly enough, NYT&rsquo;s writer wasn&rsquo;t too fond for Google&rsquo;s approach to humanize A.I., but they also named OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT Ad the best ad of the night. Which to some regard, I understand that OpenAI is the leading maker of all things AI. ChatGPT is the Google Search of AI.</p>
<p>Over on Threads, quite a few people had emotional reactions to Google&rsquo;s ad. I think this is what Google was going for.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Chris Carley, despite being a Google Pixel customer, is consistently critical of Google.  Therefore, his use of the phrase &lsquo;did me dirty&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t unexpected.  I admire his dedication to critiquing Google products—a balance I try to maintain in my own feedback. See his post below.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The commercial was generally well-received, and I was impressed.  It successfully captured a human and relatable tone, demonstrating Gemini&rsquo;s practical applications on the Pixel.  The subtle approach to Pixel promotion aligns with Android&rsquo;s focus on user choice (within its own ecosystem).  While the ad masterfully evoked human emotion, the sales message felt slightly less developed, which kept it from an &lsquo;A&rsquo; grade.  Strategically, Google may have prioritized associating human emotion with the brand over direct sales.  Perhaps a relatable celebrity could have further amplified this emotional connection.  Regardless, I found it highly enjoyable.</p>
<p>Now go rewatch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDorKy-13ak">Kendrick Lamar&rsquo;s halftime performance</a>.</p>

		<a href="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/02/09/super-bowl-sunday-and-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-02-09 16:53:47 -0700">Feb 9, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Okay, so today&rsquo;s Super Bowl Sunday. Big deal, right? Just another excuse to wear a jersey and eat questionable snacks. But seriously, even my church got in on the action. I swear, the place looked like a Cowboys fan club meeting – and as a Commanders fan, I&rsquo;m contractually obligated to be bitter. But all those jerseys got me thinking…</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s curious, isn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s not just football teams that inspire this kind of devotion. America has its own set of &ldquo;teams&rdquo; – not all of them athletic – that people rally behind. Think Cowboys, Yankees, Lakers, sure, but also Apple, and even Taylor Swift. It&rsquo;s fascinating how we choose these &ldquo;teams&rdquo; and how fiercely we defend them.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s be real, this tribalism isn&rsquo;t just about the big names. It&rsquo;s in the small things too. Think about the great Android vs. iPhone debate. Green bubbles vs. blue bubbles. It&rsquo;s a digital divide that separates friends and families (okay, maybe that&rsquo;s a bit dramatic). But seriously, it&rsquo;s another example of how we find our tribe and stick with them, even when it comes to something as silly as phone preferences.</p>
<p>Anytime someone steps away from the beloved teams, you&rsquo;re practically an outcast (just kidding&hellip; mostly). But seriously, it does feel like we&rsquo;re wired to belong, to find our tribe. Whether it&rsquo;s a sports team, a brand, or even a pop star, we find something to connect with and declare our allegiance. We&rsquo;re tribal creatures, after all.</p>
<p>This whole jersey-filled Sunday got me wondering, why do we do this? What is it about being part of something bigger than ourselves that&rsquo;s so appealing? Psychologists have explored this, suggesting it taps into our need for community and identity. Being a fan connects us to something larger, giving us a sense of belonging and shared purpose. It&rsquo;s like having an extended family of fellow fans.
But it goes beyond just feeling good. Our &ldquo;team&rdquo; affiliations can influence how we see the world, from what we buy to how we interact with others. Think about it: do you find yourself more drawn to people who share your fandoms? Do you subtly (or not so subtly) judge those who root for the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; team? It&rsquo;s funny how these seemingly small allegiances can shape our perceptions and even our relationships.</p>
<p>And where do we draw the line between healthy fandom and, well, not-so-healthy tribalism? So, from Cowboys jerseys to green bubbles, it seems we&rsquo;re always finding new ways to define our tribes. The question is, why? Maybe it&rsquo;s something to think about as we head into the rest of the week.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got the Chiefs winning, even though I want the Eagles to win.</p>

			 <p>In the <a href="https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/pixel-superfans/">Pixel Superfans community</a>, a member recently shared a photo, sparking a wave of nostalgia. They asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Android fans, I picked up this Android cookie jar which I&rsquo;m unfamiliar with. I&rsquo;m looking for any info anyone remembers about it. It&rsquo;s from 2011, but I&rsquo;m not sure if this was a Google employee gift or sold somewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love discovering vintage Android merchandise online! This particular find was an Android cookie jar from 2011, sold on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120226015731/http://www.googlestore.com/Accessories/Android+Cookie+Jar.axd">original Google Store</a>. Now, you might be wondering, what kind of cookies would you put in it? Any Android aficionado, or perhaps someone who worked at Google at the time, would know that 2011 was the year of Android 2.3 Gingerbread (released in late December 2010). So, the only right thing to do was to fill it with Android-shaped gingerbread cookies. It was a whimsical time, when Android was only two to three years old.</p>
<p>This cookie jar is more than just a kitchen gadget; it&rsquo;s a tangible piece of Android&rsquo;s vibrant history. It represents a time of rapid innovation and a burgeoning community of enthusiasts. Finding these relics reminds us of how far Android has come, and how deeply rooted its passionate fan base is.</p>
<p>To all ex-Google, veteran Google employees or long-standing Android fans, if you have any vintage Android treasures hiding in your cupboards, please share more of them!</p>

<p>If you blinked you might&rsquo;ve missed it, but Kendrick Lamar did a live interview with Apple Music Nadeska and Ebro to discuss his journey leading up to the Superbowl:</p>
<p>On the topic of authenticity, Kendrick Lamar had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number one thing people feel in the room, over love and over fears, is authenticity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He spoke about how he had been in rooms where people felt his authentic self so intensely that it inspired them. He continued on saying the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;To stay authentic, you have to believe in yourself and know that there is only one you. You are unique and a miracle. When you wake up every day and realize that you are an individual, you have to carry that authentic nature and allow yourself to say, &ldquo;This is who I am. This is how people are going to see me and respect me.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s going to inspire people to have truth. When everyone is authentic, what comes out of that is true love. There are no boundaries, no judgment, and no perception of being able to ridicule anyone because you are showing up as your true self.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nadeska leaned in on all that happened this past summer'24, during the rap sparring against Drake, without naming him of course. I love what Kendrick had to say.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love the competitive spirit of hip-hop and that was the thing just for this year. It was always a continuum. It was more from a space where a lot of people were putting rap to the back and you didn&rsquo;t see that grit, you didn&rsquo;t see that bite anymore. I always took that into consideration when going into any time with his music.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you but I&rsquo;m looking forward to the Superbowl performance next week. Definitely check out the interview if you can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Casey Newton</strong>: <em>I realize this is now the standard UI, but I truly don&rsquo;t understand how an average person is supposed to decide which model to use for which task</em></p>
<p><strong>John Gruber</strong>: <em>This is where it especially sucks that Apple isn’t a player in the game, because they’d have either just one model or two tops (regular/pro).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/screenshot-2025-02-06-165952.png" alt="Auto-generated description: A Twitter conversation shows a user expressing confusion about the options in a list of text models, with someone else commenting on the lack of a specific company&rsquo;s involvement."></p>
<p>Both of them are absolutely right, especially John Gruber, to some extent because we all know Apple would have what Joanna Stern suggests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I count at least four&hellip;</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence,
Apple Intelligence Plus,
Apple Intelligence Pro,
Apple Intelligence Pro Max</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/screenshot-2025-02-06-165817.png" alt="Auto-generated description: A social media thread discussing Apple&rsquo;s absence in a certain market, humorously suggesting potential product names like Apple Intelligence, Apple Intelligence Plus, Apple Intelligence Pro, and Apple Intelligence Pro Max."></p>
<p>While Google engineers are likely working diligently on the Gemini models, it appears that product managers may have lost sight of user needs, or perhaps user feedback indicates a desire for an excessive number of features. Personally, I believe a simplified approach is best.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/screenshot-2025-02-06-171429.png" alt="Auto-generated description: A menu displays options for Gemini Advanced with plans titled Flash for everyday tasks and Pro for complex tasks and in-depth answers."></p>
<p>First, echoing John Gruber&rsquo;s suggestion, there should be only two models. Let&rsquo;s start with Flash. While I&rsquo;m not entirely sold on the name, the model is certainly fast and lightweight (and presumably the least expensive to run), which aligns with the name&rsquo;s implication.  The &ldquo;Experimental&rdquo; models, both Flash and Pro, should be accessible via an opt-in toggle in the settings. This keeps them out of the way for average users while still providing access for those who want them.  If Gemini 2.0 Flash is available, the Gemini 1.5 Flash model should be discontinued. Maintaining multiple versions of the same model can lead to confusion and redundancy, hindering a clear user experience.</p>
<p>The Gemini Pro model should, as its name suggests, be the one that handles complex tasks and provides in-depth answers. I understand that the &ldquo;in-depth answers&rdquo; aspect is tied to the &ldquo;Deep Research&rdquo; feature (which allows users to delve deeper into a topic by providing additional context and sources), but in my experience with Gemini, I typically choose when I want to engage in deep research, and that feels like a &ldquo;Pro-tier&rdquo; experience.  Again, the &ldquo;Experimental&rdquo; Pro model should be hidden behind the opt-in toggle in the settings, away from the average user. Here&rsquo;s how this could be implemented on the Pixel 9 Pro.</p>

			 <p>If Google&rsquo;s Pixel phones didn&rsquo;t exist, the Samsung Galaxy S25 would top my smartphone list. Samsung flagships offer a perfect balance. They have the widespread acceptance and accessory compatibility of iPhones, making finding cases and accessories a breeze. Simultaneously, they embrace the best of the Android ecosystem, including Google&rsquo;s innovative software and cutting-edge AI. The incredibly useful &ldquo;Circle to Search&rdquo; feature, which debuted on the Galaxy S24, exemplifies this. For a great comparison of AI features, I’d highly recommend checking out MKBHD’s series of AI Reality vs. AI Commercials.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Beyond individual features, the current Android landscape is thriving. It&rsquo;s a fantastic time to be an Android user, with excellent devices from companies like Nothing, Samsung, OnePlus, and Google. Even Motorola is back in the mix. In the AI era, Android is truly leading the pack, particularly with Google&rsquo;s Gemini. While the Ultra or S25+ might be tempting, the standard Galaxy S25 is likely the sweet spot for me. Samsung&rsquo;s One UI, with its deep customization for enhanced productivity, is a major draw. Coupled with the increasing integration of Gemini AI directly within Android, the S25 presents a compelling package. This blend of hardware, software, and AI makes the Galaxy S25 my preferred Android, Pixel phones aside.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Paradise&rdquo; is a sleeper show with a lot going for it, even in its pilot episode, and it boasts a stellar cast including Sterling K. Brown (best known as Randall on &ldquo;This Is Us&rdquo;) and James Marsden (known as Teddy in HBO&rsquo;s &ldquo;Westworld&rdquo;). With the season halfway through, the plot has already thickened and it promises even more twists to come.</p>
<p>Without spoiling anything, I&rsquo;d suggest that anyone who is considering watching it do so without looking up the plot or synopsis. Just go in completely blind! This show has the serious vibes of Apple TV+’s “Silo”, but I can&rsquo;t elaborate without giving things away! I&rsquo;ll come back to this blog post after the first season concludes on March 4th; the show runs every Tuesday. I want to talk about what&rsquo;s happened and what this show reminds me of so badly, but I’m afraid that if I do, I&rsquo;d inadvertently spoil things.</p>
<p>So for now, I suggest just watching it for yourself. You won’t regret it.</p>
<p>Let me know if you&rsquo;d like me to elaborate on any of these points or if you have any other questions!</p>

		<a href="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/02/05/why-im-disappointed-in-googles.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-02-05 10:25:47 -0700">Feb 5, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Google has made a troubling decision. That&rsquo;s what I thought after reading the headline, &ldquo;Google Lifts a Ban on Using Its AI for Weapons and Surveillance,&rdquo; on my Google News feed. My first thought was of Google&rsquo;s former motto, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be evil.&rdquo; Though those words were removed years ago, many hoped that some vestige of that ethos remained internally. Now, it appears Google is continuing to dismantle its ethical framework.</p>
<p>In 2018, as the AI race accelerated, Google published its &ldquo;AI Principles,&rdquo; outlining applications they would not pursue. I applauded Google for these commitments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We will not design or deploy AI in the following application areas:</strong></p>
<p><em>1. Technologies that cause or are likely to cause overall harm.  Where there is a material risk of harm, we will proceed only where we believe that the benefits substantially outweigh the risks, and will incorporate appropriate safety constraints.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people.</em></p>
<p><em>3. Technologies that gather or use information for surveillance violating internationally accepted norms.</em></p>
<p><em>4. Technologies whose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While some might consider these the bare minimum for a company of Google&rsquo;s size, many wondered if they would uphold them. It seems that cautious optimism has given way to &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; as Google has revised these &ldquo;principles.&rdquo; As Wired reported, Google executives cited the growing use of AI, evolving standards, and geopolitical competition as the reasons for revising their principles.</p>
<p>What was overhauled? Conspicuously absent is the entire section from 2018 regarding prohibited AI applications. The &ldquo;overhauled&rdquo; principles now focus on three aspects: <strong>Bold Innovation</strong>, <strong>Responsible Development and Deployment</strong>, and <strong>Collaborative Progress, Together</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bold Innovation</strong>: <em>We develop AI to assist, empower, and inspire people in almost every field of human endeavor, drive economic progress and improve lives, enable scientific breakthroughs, and help address humanity&rsquo;s biggest challenges.</em></p>
<p><strong>Responsible Development and Deployment</strong>: <em>Because we understand that AI, as a still-emerging transformative technology, poses new complexities and risks, we consider it an imperative to pursue AI responsibly throughout the development and deployment lifecycle — from design to testing to deployment to iteration — learning as AI advances and uses evolve.</em></p>
<p><strong>Collaborative Progress, Together</strong>: <em>We learn from others, and build technology that empowers others to harness AI positively.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shift illustrates what happens when a company grows to such a scale. It begins to be influenced by prevailing political winds.  This realization represents a personal evolution. For decades, I followed tech news and was excited about gadgets, viewing them primarily as just that—fun gadgets. I overlooked the ethical responsibilities involved. The past ten years have shown me the far-reaching effects of these &ldquo;gadgets&rdquo; at scale. All of these technologies—smartphones, tablets, AI, software, and services—have a dual nature. Products can be announced with shiny, inspiring keynotes promising to &ldquo;make the world a better place,&rdquo; but they also have a darker side. <strong>This is Google&rsquo;s dark side today, and I strongly disapprove of it.</strong> This decision could lead to the development of AI-powered weapons systems, increased surveillance, and other ethically problematic applications.</p>

		<a href="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/02/04/gemini-pro-vs-flash-decoding.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-02-04 13:30:00 -0700">Feb 4, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Choosing the right AI tool for your Drupal development workflow can be tricky.  Google&rsquo;s Gemini offers two powerful options: 1.5 Pro and 2.0 Flash. While both can assist with tasks like code debugging, their strengths lie in different areas. This post breaks down the key differences, focusing on practical examples for PHP and Twig within the Drupal context.</p>
<p><strong>Gemini 1.5 Pro: The Deep Dive Expert</strong></p>
<p>Think of 1.5 Pro as your seasoned consultant. It excels at in-depth analysis and complex problem-solving. Its strength lies in understanding nuanced code issues, often buried within layers of logic.  It&rsquo;s ideal for situations where careful examination and context are paramount.</p>
<p><strong>Gemini 2.0 Flash: The Speedy Problem Solver</strong></p>
<p>2.0 Flash is your quick-thinking colleague. It&rsquo;s designed for speed and efficiency, perfect for rapid iteration and tackling straightforward bugs.  It shines when you need immediate feedback and fast solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Debugging PHP and Twig: A Practical Comparison</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine a scenario: a Twig template in your Drupal project isn&rsquo;t displaying a variable correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Gemini 1.5 Pro Approach:</strong></p>
<p>You provide 1.5 Pro with the problematic Twig code, the relevant PHP code that populates the variable, and a description of the expected output.  1.5 Pro meticulously analyzes both, tracing the variable&rsquo;s journey from the PHP code to the Twig template. It might identify a typo in the variable name, a logic error in the PHP code that&rsquo;s preventing the variable from being set, or a scope issue.  It may even suggest related Drupal documentation or best practices for handling variables in Twig.  The response might take a little longer, but it&rsquo;s thorough and provides a deep understanding of the root cause.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>twig
{# Problematic Twig Code #}
{{ user_namee }}

{# Related PHP Code #}
$user_name = \Drupal::currentUser()-&gt;getAccount()-&gt;getDisplayName();
// ...some other code...
$build['user_name'] = $user_name;

**1.5 Pro might respond:** _&quot;The Twig template is trying to display user_namee, but the PHP code defines the variable as user_name.  This typo is preventing the name from being displayed.  Correct the Twig code to_  {{ user_name }}.&quot;
</code></pre><p><strong>Gemini 2.0 Flash Approach:</strong>
You provide 2.0 Flash with the same code snippets.  It quickly scans for common errors.  It might immediately flag the typo in the variable name and suggest the correction.  While it might not delve into the broader context of the code as deeply as 1.5 Pro, its speed is invaluable for quickly catching these common mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Example (same code as above):</strong>
2.0 Flash might respond: &ldquo;Possible typo: user_namee in Twig should be user_name to match the PHP variable.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Which One to Choose?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use 1.5 Pro: When you&rsquo;re dealing with complex bugs, unfamiliar code, or when you need a deep understanding of the issue.  Think of it as your go-to for those &ldquo;head-scratching&rdquo; moments.</li>
<li>Use 2.0 Flash: When you need rapid feedback, are working on straightforward tasks, or want to quickly catch common errors. It&rsquo;s perfect for iterative development and those &ldquo;aha!&rdquo; moments.
By understanding the strengths of each version, you can leverage Gemini to boost your Drupal development productivity and streamline your debugging process.  They aren&rsquo;t mutually exclusive; use them strategically to maximize your efficiency.</li>
</ul>

			 <p><a href="https://tv.google.com/share/title/Crooklyn?m=CgkvbS8wNmwycGo">Crooklyn</a> is one of those classic films that really depicts a lot of kids reality growing up especially in the inner city.  The movie is based out of the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York and my wife explained this reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of kids experienced and witnessed a lot of things growing up with the amount of independence they had in the city. Walking a couple blocks to the corner store to grab groceries for the family, candy (why not?), and whatever else the parents asked to get.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spike Lee&rsquo;s Crooklyn is a total vibe, right?  But beyond the funky clothes and killer soundtrack, something else really struck me: the sheer independence of the kids.  Especially Troy.  She&rsquo;s dealing with life at an age when I was still figuring out how to tie my shoes.  Seriously, her level of responsibility is something you just don&rsquo;t see much anymore.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I kinda envy her.  Kids back then seemed to have this crazy resourcefulness, like they could handle anything.  Running errands, navigating the neighborhood on their own, contributing to the family…  It makes me wonder, did we lose something along the way?  All that responsibility probably built some serious character.  I mean, can you imagine a kid today taking the subway by themselves?  Probably not. But then again, there&rsquo;s a part of me that&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Whoa, slow down.&rdquo;  All that independence came with a price.  Did they really get to just be kids?  Sometimes I feel like we&rsquo;re so busy trying to protect our kids from everything that we forget they need space to figure things out on their own.  There&rsquo;s a sweet spot somewhere, right? A balance between letting kids explore and shielding them from the tough stuff.</p>
<p>Crooklyn totally got me thinking about all this.  It&rsquo;s a reminder that childhood is fleeting, whether you&rsquo;re navigating the streets of Brooklyn in the 70s or scrolling through TikTok in the 2020s.  It makes you wonder, what kind of childhood are we giving our kids today? And is it really better than what came before?</p>

			 <p>While the accomplishments of Black individuals throughout American history deserve recognition and celebration year-round, February provides a dedicated time to amplify and honor the inspiring contributions of Black people in America. I&rsquo;ve long admired Google&rsquo;s commitment to showcasing Black excellence as an integral part of American excellence, both through their products and during my three years working there.</p>
<p>Here are five ways Google is celebrating Black History Month across its platforms as posted on <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/diversity/black-history-month-2025/?utm_source=threads&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=og&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=">The Keyword</a>:</p>

			 <p>The other day, while I was listening to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWz5rJ2EKKc-pGh0SJ7hScCv-jepzHTuU">&ldquo;Android Developers Backstage&rdquo; Podcast</a>, my Pixel vibrated and asked me to &ldquo;Bring Pixel closer to Tablet&rdquo;. Of course, I followed my pocket Android&rsquo;s instructions and Voilà! &ldquo;Tap to Cast&rdquo; automagically casted the podcast to my Pixel Tablet. You can see below:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You might&rsquo;ve see this already posted on Threads and BlueSky (which took forever to upload btw), but I thought it was so cool! I heard about the feature when it was announced, but I never knew when it would reach my devices. It was a nice surprise. Especially when it was a happenstance instead of, like I used to, spam the update button to get the latest features. I need to take on that practice more. See the feature announced and go about my day, not angrily spam the &ldquo;update&rdquo; button and shake my fist at the clouds like a mad man, trying to force the feature to my devices.</p>
<p>I digress. Abner at <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/01/09/pixel-tablet-tap-to-cast/">9to5Google explained it best</a> back in January, 2024:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When listening with YouTube Music or Spotify, bringing your Pixel 6 Pro, 7 Pro, 8 Pro, or Fold – which all have UWB (Ultra-Wideband) – near a docked Pixel Tablet will seamlessly move what’s playing between devices. This is bidirectional with the ability to transfer a song from the Pixel Tablet to your Pixel phone also available.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Officially, Google is using a “range of technologies to determine the proximity and presence of devices as part of multi-device experiences, which includes UWB.” Its Cross device SDK was announced in 2022 and consists of three layers:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>“The first layer recognizes what devices are physically close by, with wireless technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi, and ultra-wideband (UWB).”</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>“The second layer is nearby device discovery and context-aware capabilities that identify which device you may want to use based on your current activity.”</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>“Finally, the third layer understands and adjusts actions based on how you interact with your devices with cross-device intelligence.”</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Google went as far to explain that &ldquo;Tap to Cast&rdquo; is available without any additional work if developers integrate <a href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/android_sender/output_switcher">Output Switcher (2.0) on Android 14</a>. Right now, it&rsquo;s only available with YouTube Music and Spotify with UWB enabled Pixel devices like my Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel Tablet. It&rsquo;s nice to know that this isn&rsquo;t an exclusive Pixel feature so more hardware and apps could be supported in the future!</p>

		<a href="https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/01/31/apple-is-really-trying-to.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-01-31 11:49:57 -0700">Jan 31, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1158.0_1.pdf">Apple, a key witness in the US government&rsquo;s case against Google, is seeking a more active role in the remedies phase of the trial where solutions to Google&rsquo;s search monopoly will be decided.</a> They are concerned that the government&rsquo;s proposed remedies, which include ending lucrative deals between Apple and Google, will negatively impact them. Despite the judge denying their request to participate directly, Apple is appealing the decision and asking for a stay in the proceedings to ensure their interests are adequately represented.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Apple understands that this Court intends to adhere to the “strict confines of the [C]ourt’s Scheduling Order,” Order Denying Limited Intervention at 16, Jan. 27, 2025, ECF No. 1153, Apple has no choice but to move for a stay of these proceedings to protect its rights pending appeal. Absent a stay, Apple will suffer irreparable harm: the deprivation of its right to participate as a party in the remedial phase of this case moving forward, including possibly at the trial itself, while its undisputed property rights are adjudicated. These harms are magnified by a position Plaintiffs revealed in a recent meet-and-confer with Apple. Specifically, Plaintiffs represented that they intend to challenge this Court’s decision permitting Apple to submit up to two affidavits during the trial. Courts have commonly granted stays pending appeal of orders denying intervention, and this Court should do the same here. In the alternative, the Court should at minimum afford Apple full access to the record as a nonparty until the D.C. Circuit rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple continues explaining how much the desired outcome will hurt them with &ldquo;irreparable harm&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Second, Apple will suffer clear and substantial irreparable harm if it is unable to participate in the remedies phase moving forward. Apple will be unable to participate in discovery and develop evidence in the targeted fashion it has proposed as this litigation progresses toward a final judgment. If Apple’s appeal is not resolved until during or after the remedies trial, Apple may well be forced to stand mute at trial, as a mere spectator, while the government pursues an extreme remedy that targets Apple by name and would prohibit any commercial arrangement between Apple and Google for a decade. This would leave Apple without the ability to defend its right to reach other arrangements with Google that could benefit millions of users and Apple’s entitlement to compensation for distributing Google search to its users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I totally understand Apple&rsquo;s argument here, but allow me to explain further in a fun analogy I came up with to explain it to my wife.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a playground where kids (users) love to use the swings (search engines). Google owns most of the swings and decides who gets to use them. Apple owns the playground and makes a deal with Google: Google pays Apple a lot of money to make sure their swings are the only ones easily available to the kids. Now, the playground teachers (the government) say Google isn&rsquo;t playing fair and has too much control over the swings. They want to change the rules to give other swing makers a chance. Apple is worried because if the kids can use any swings they want, Google might not pay them anymore.</p>
<p>So, Apple wants to talk to the teachers and explain why they think their deal with Google is good for the playground. They also want to make sure the new rules don&rsquo;t make the playground worse for everyone.</p>
<p>Analogies are hard, but she totally understood exactly what&rsquo;s happening here and you want to know what her answer was? <strong><em>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t Apple just make their own swings? They are a trillion dollar company aren&rsquo;t they?&quot;</em></strong> 😏</p>

			 <p>As an #Android fan, I&rsquo;m always eager to learn more about the ecosystem, and the <a href="https://youtu.be/IhP4xwRPJGY?si=MtRQTyY0UgEZyxRI">&ldquo;Android Developers Backstage&rdquo; podcast</a> is a fantastic resource.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been doing it for a while now, and in this episode, they take us back to the &ldquo;before Android Studio&rdquo; days. It&rsquo;s fascinating to hear from some of the actual Android development team—Chet, Romain, and Tor, brought on special guests Xav, and Jamal to talk about their experiences and the journey of Android Studio. Even reaching back to when Eclipse was the IDE of choice and the transition and excitement to Android Studio.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty cool to get this kind of insider knowledge from the people who actually build Android Studio. If you&rsquo;re an Android enthusiast like me, you&rsquo;ll definitely want to check out this episode of &ldquo;Android Developers Backstage&rdquo;!</p>

<p>This sounds like Google is letting the extra bulk roll off voluntarily? To me this sounds like the equivalent to when<a href="https://youtu.be/M3J8OVnKtM8?si=tLDuHUdE07cIf7oT"> Steve Jobs asked Jony Ive his &ldquo;why&rdquo; to him being on the Mac team</a>. Google provided a full statement to 9to5Google below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Platforms &amp; Devices team is offering a voluntary exit program that provides US-based Googlers working on this team the ability to voluntarily leave the company with a severance package. This comes after we brought two large organizations together last year. There’s tremendous momentum on this team and with so much important work ahead, we want everyone to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming this was a conversation that happened when the Platform &amp; Devices team restructured to a more <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/01/10/google-reorganizing-hardware/">functional organization model</a> a year ago. Something Apple and other hardware makers do to bring more focus on their products. Now that Google is truly in it&rsquo;s Gemini era, Pixel, Nest, and Fitbit truly need to be the vehicles for Google&rsquo;s vision. Especially with Android XR getting a lot of positive reception from the public. I&rsquo;m hoping Google lives up to the hype in 2025 as I know quite a few individuals on that team that have done some amazing work already.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This post is inspired by Parker Ortolani&rsquo;s thought-provoking question, <a href="https://parker.micro.blog/2025/01/29/where-are-the-bluesky-clients.html">&ldquo;Where are the BlueSky Clients?&quot;</a>.  Like Ortolani, I&rsquo;m puzzled by the apparent focus on Mastodon clients over BlueSky clients by developers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;what I can’t wrap my head around is the business decision of developers to lean into Mastodon clients versus Bluesky ones.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ortolani&rsquo;s observation about developers leaning towards ActivityPub despite BlueSky&rsquo;s larger user base (30 million vs. Mastodon&rsquo;s 9 million) raises a valid point. While the extensive tooling available for ActivityPub development might be a factor, I suspect there&rsquo;s more to the story.  Perhaps I&rsquo;m wrong, but I believe a stronger connection between the Android, ActivityPub, and AT Protocol communities is crucial, given their shared focus on decentralized infrastructure.</p>
<p>My own perspective on the Fediverse and social media ownership has shifted recently. I&rsquo;m striving to recapture the joy of social platforms as spaces for community and collaboration, rather than succumbing to the pressures of capitalism and centralized control. This very shift prompted me to migrate my blog from Substack to Micro.blog.  I appreciate that Micro.blog offers an Android app, and while it&rsquo;s currently basic, I hope to see more active development on the Android front. A friend of mine has <a href="https://cool-as-heck.blog/a-blog-post-about-blogs/">a blog that breaks down the different Activity Pub blogging platforms</a> that I think is incredibly useful, but it&rsquo;s solely available as a web app.</p>
<p>This brings me to a key point. I&rsquo;ve even considered exploring Android app development myself, alongside my full-stack web development work. I understand the time and effort required to build clients, and I&rsquo;m genuinely grateful for platforms like Micro.blog that offer apps in the Play Store (or even sideloadable on Android).  However, I believe a stronger synergy with Android, the world&rsquo;s most popular mobile operating system, is essential for the growth of decentralized social media.</p>
<p>For a decentralized network, prioritizing web development followed by Android development seems logical.  Focusing primarily on the web and then closed ecosystems like iPadOS and iOS feels counterintuitive.  Perhaps I&rsquo;m missing a critical piece of the puzzle, but it strikes me as a backwards approach.</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t we seeing more development for the most accessible and widespread mobile platform?</p>

			 <p>After watching <a href="https://youtu.be/az5QL_NLBvg?si=MACQItzAR7btcDXy">Marques Brownlee&rsquo;s exclusive look</a> at the Samsung prototype running Android XR, I&rsquo;m buzzing with a level of excitement I haven&rsquo;t felt for a new tech platform in years. While Apple&rsquo;s visionOS and Meta&rsquo;s HorizonOS are intriguing, Android XR feels different. It carries the same vibrant energy as the early days of Android, promising a wave of innovation and diverse hardware experiences that could truly revolutionize the XR space.</p>
<p>Think back to the launch of Android. Every time Google&rsquo;s mobile OS enters a new form factor – smartphones, tablets, smartwatches – it ignites a spark. Suddenly, a flurry of manufacturers, both established giants and nimble startups, emerge with unique hardware interpretations. We see a burst of creativity, pushing the boundaries of design and functionality. This is precisely what Android XR promises for headsets.</p>
<p>The open nature of Android fosters a healthy ecosystem. It&rsquo;s not just one company dictating the entire experience, limiting choices and stifling innovation. Instead, Android XR empowers hardware makers to focus on what they do best: crafting amazing devices. Companies like Sony, XReal, and countless others we haven&rsquo;t even heard of yet will have access to a robust software foundation, allowing them to differentiate themselves through innovative hardware designs and specialized features. This echoes the dynamism we&rsquo;ve seen in the Android smartphone market, and it&rsquo;s precisely what the XR space needs.</p>
<p>But the excitement doesn&rsquo;t stop at the open ecosystem. What truly blew me away was the sheer polish and sophistication of the Android XR software, even in its prototype stage. Remember those early &ldquo;Nexus&rdquo; devices, the developer previews that often left a lot to be desired? Think back to the barebones experience of the first Nexus phones or the initial Android Wear watches like the LG G Watch. Android XR is a completely different beast. It&rsquo;s clear that Google and Samsung have poured significant effort into crafting a premium software experience from the get-go.</p>
<p>The integration of AI, exemplified by the Gemini assistant, is truly mind-blowing. Seeing how effortlessly Gemini can be used for navigation, app interaction, and even real-time environmental information feels like stepping into the realm of science fiction – in the best possible way. The &ldquo;circle to search&rdquo; feature, similar to Google Lens, adds another layer of intuitive interaction. It feels like we&rsquo;re witnessing the birth of a truly intelligent and immersive computing platform.</p>
<p>This whole experience resonates deeply with me. As I&rsquo;ve been reading Chet Haase&rsquo;s &ldquo;<strong>Androids: The Team that Built the Android Operating System</strong>,&rdquo; the collaboration between Samsung and Google on Android XR feels like a modern-day parallel to the &ldquo;mixing bowl&rdquo; of engineering talent that birthed the original Android. Just like the engineers from Danger, Be/PalmSource, and WebTV/Microsoft came together to create something magical, the partnership between Samsung and Google has the potential to shape the future of XR. But where exactly does Android XR fit within the broader Android ecosystem? We&rsquo;ve seen Android expand into smartphones, tablets, wearables&hellip; how does this new form factor integrate, and what possibilities does it unlock?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m keeping my expectations in check for now, but the potential of Android XR is undeniable. More than just one company selling its ecosystem and controlling every aspect of the experience, Android XR represents a fundamental shift. It&rsquo;s a platform that fosters open innovation, empowers hardware makers, and promises a diverse range of devices and experiences. It&rsquo;s the dawn of a new era in headset technology, and I, for one, am incredibly excited to see what the future holds.</p>
<p>Which brings us to an even bigger question: what is XR for? Is this the future of gaming, offering experiences far beyond what consoles can deliver? Is it destined to replace our desktop computers, providing immersive workspaces and holographic collaboration? Or is it something else entirely, a new category of computing that we can&rsquo;t even fully imagine yet? These are the questions that keep me up at night, pondering the possibilities.</p>

The tech landscape is shifting under our feet, and Google, despite its dominance, can&rsquo;t afford to stand still.

And with Gemini, they&rsquo;re poised to do it again, bringing powerful AI experiences to the masses in a way that OpenAI, for all its innovation, simply can&rsquo;t match.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course, there are challenges. Regulators are circling, competition is fierce, and the pace of AI development is relentless. But Google has the resources, the talent, and the determination to come out on top. 2025 is shaping up to be a defining year for Google, and I, for one, am excited to see what they deliver.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

While I respect Wired&rsquo;s perspective, I disagree with their assessment. I believe the Apple Vision Pro is not a flop, but rather a bold step into the future of mixed reality.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Senior Commerce Editor Julian Chokkattu <!-- raw HTML omitted -->highlights some valid points in his section on the Vision Pro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;I am writing this story on the Apple Vision Pro. I like using it for work more so than entertainment, though I did watch The Weeknd&rsquo;s Open Hearts, an interactive music experience where I was face-to-face with the musician as he was being hauled away in an ambulance through various Inception-esque environments. The visual quality of the film is impressive and it feels immersive to watch—you can see beads of sweat on his face—but there are also moments when the camera changes to sweeping views that look too grainy and pixelated. Apple has released several immersive experiences like this throughout 2024, including a film called Submerged.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Technically, I&rsquo;m using the Vision Pro in Mac Virtual Display mode. I have it wirelessly connected to Apple&rsquo;s new Mac Mini, which brings your computer&rsquo;s screen into a spatial environment, allowing you to place other visionOS apps around it. This mode now gives you options for your Mac&rsquo;s screen size: Standard, Wide, and Ultrawide. I&rsquo;m using the latter and have two browser windows open side by side, plus Slack off to the left, and I&rsquo;m using Apple&rsquo;s Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad. It&rsquo;s great.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s hard not to leave the Vision Pro experience without feeling impressed each time, though I wish this darn battery cable was a little longer. (It slid off my desk while I was wearing the headset, but I thankfully caught the pack before it pulled the wire.) But with Google and Samsung&rsquo;s recent announcement of Android XR, we can expect similar mixed-reality headsets on the way in 2025, and I have a hard time believing most of them will cost as much as the Vision Pro. That&rsquo;s ultimately the main problem with Apple&rsquo;s big 2024 release: It&rsquo;s too far out of reach for almost everyone.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Think back to the original iPhone. It was expensive, had limited functionality compared to today&rsquo;s standards, and yet, it revolutionized the mobile phone industry.

While the prospect of an Apple-branded search experience might pique the curiosity of tech enthusiasts, a closer look reveals this is a shrewd decision that aligns perfectly with Apple&rsquo;s core business strategy.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eddy Cue, Apple&rsquo;s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, recently filed a declaration, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reported by Reuters<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, with a U.S. federal court outlining the company&rsquo;s rationale. Cue&rsquo;s arguments are compelling, painting a picture of a project fraught with challenges and misaligned with Apple&rsquo;s strengths, stating the following:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The development of a search engine would cost Apple &ldquo;billions of dollars&rdquo; and &ldquo;take many years,&rdquo; and this would divert investment money and employees away from &ldquo;other growth areas&rdquo; that the company is focused on.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The search business is &ldquo;rapidly evolving&rdquo; due to artificial intelligence, so it would be &ldquo;economically risky&rdquo; for Apple to create a search engine.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In order to create a &ldquo;viable&rdquo; search engine business, Apple would be required to &ldquo;sell targeted advertising,&rdquo; which is &ldquo;not a core business&rdquo; for the company and would go against its &ldquo;longstanding privacy commitments.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple does not have enough &ldquo;specialized professionals&rdquo; and &ldquo;operational infrastructure&rdquo; needed to build and run a successful search engine business.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But here&rsquo;s the kicker: Apple doesn&rsquo;t need to build a search engine. Their lucrative partnership with Google, where Google pays a hefty sum to remain the default search engine on Apple devices, is a cash cow. This arrangement provides Apple with a steady stream of revenue without the headaches and risks associated with building and running their own search engine.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In essence, Apple has recognized that sometimes the best strategy is to double down on your strengths and forge strategic partnerships. By focusing on what they do best – creating beautiful, user-friendly devices and cultivating a loyal customer base – Apple can reap the rewards of the search market without getting their hands dirty.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This decision underscores Apple&rsquo;s pragmatic approach to business. They understand that not every battle is worth fighting, and sometimes the most profitable path lies in collaboration, not competition. And with Google effectively bankrolling a significant portion of their business, it&rsquo;s a strategy that seems to be paying off handsomely.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

A court recently took issue with the tech giant&rsquo;s search distribution contracts, essentially saying they stifle competition. While Google plans to appeal the decision, it&rsquo;s also playing the game by proposing remedies to address the court&rsquo;s concerns.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In essence, the court found that Google&rsquo;s agreements with browser and device makers to feature its search engine as the default option were anti-competitive. Google, naturally, disagrees, arguing its dominance stems from building a superior product and making savvy business decisions.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, before you picture Google being carved up like a Thanksgiving turkey, let me tell you about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->their proposed remedies<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. They&rsquo;re actually quite interesting.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Gist of Google&rsquo;s Proposal<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Browsers get more freedom:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Companies like Apple and Mozilla can still make deals with Google Search, but they&rsquo;ll have more flexibility. They can set different default search engines for different platforms (like iPhones versus iPads) and browsing modes. Plus, they can change their default search provider at least every 12 months.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Android gets unbundled:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Device makers will have more flexibility in preloading multiple search engines and Google apps. This means you might see more variety on your Android home screen, and competitors like Microsoft get a fairer shot at placement.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oversight without overreach:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Google proposes a system to ensure compliance with the court&rsquo;s order, but without giving the government excessive control over your online experience.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My Two Cents<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Frankly, these seem like reasonable proposals. It&rsquo;s like Google is saying, &ldquo;Okay, we hear you, but let&rsquo;s not throw the baby out with the bathwater.&rdquo; They acknowledge the need for a more level playing field while still protecting their hard-earned innovations.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The idea of platform-specific search defaults is particularly intriguing. Imagine your iPhone defaulting to DuckDuckGo for privacy, while your iPad sticks with Google for its familiar interface. This kind of flexibility could empower users and foster competition.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unbundling search from other Google apps on Android is also a smart move. It addresses a key complaint from competitors while giving users more choice.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course, the devil is in the details. We&rsquo;ll have to see how these proposals play out in practice. But at first glance, Google seems to be striking a balance between addressing antitrust concerns and preserving its ability to innovate.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->While Google&rsquo;s proposals sound good on paper, I&rsquo;ll be watching closely to see how they impact consumers in the real world. Will we truly see more choice and competition in the search market? Or will Google find clever ways to maintain its dominance? Only time will tell.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Disclaimer:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This blog post reflects my personal opinions and should not be taken as legal or financial advice.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

Some are bold, some are not-so-bold, but they&rsquo;re all guaranteed to spark some interesting conversations.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. Apple Intelligence Finally Arrives (and It&rsquo;s Actually Good)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Remember that Apple Intelligence thing they teased at WWDC? Yeah, it&rsquo;s finally here, and it&rsquo;s not the dumpster fire some folks predicted. Think of it as Siri on steroids, but without the constant need to apologize for not understanding you. It can actually write your emails, schedule your appointments, and even order your groceries.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Threads: From Zero to Hero<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Remember when everyone was all over Clubhouse? Yeah, me neither. But Threads, Meta&rsquo;s answer to Twitter, is actually gaining some serious traction. I&rsquo;m predicting it&rsquo;ll hit 500 million monthly active users in 2025, proving that people still crave a place to share their thoughts in 280 characters or less (or, you know, long rambling threads).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. Google&rsquo;s Pixel 10: The MKBHD Smartphone of the Year<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google&rsquo;s been quietly chipping away at the smartphone market, and I think 2025 will be their year. The Pixel 10 will be the phone to beat, with its killer camera, clean software, and AI-powered features that actually work. I&rsquo;m predicting it will be so good, it&rsquo;ll snag the coveted MKBHD Smartphone of the Year award.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. Meta Ray-Bans: The AI Gadget You Actually Want to Wear<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Remember Google Glass? Yeah, let&rsquo;s not go there. But Meta&rsquo;s Ray-Bans are actually a pretty cool (and stylish) way to experience augmented reality. I&rsquo;m predicting they&rsquo;ll get a major update in 2025, making them the must-have AI gadget for everyone who wants to look cool and stay connected.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->5. ChatGPT: The AI That Everyone&rsquo;s Talking To<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT has been making waves, and I think it&rsquo;s only going to get bigger in 2025. I&rsquo;m predicting it&rsquo;ll hit 500 million monthly active users, as people use it for everything from writing poems to coding websites (and maybe even having a few existential conversations with a robot <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->6. Apple vs. DOJ: The Case That Goes Nowhere<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Remember that whole Apple vs. DOJ antitrust case? Yeah, I&rsquo;m predicting it&rsquo;ll fizzle out in 2025. Both sides will realize they have better things to do, like Apple designing new iPhones and the DOJ chasing after… well, someone else.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->7. Apple Vision Pro Flops, But Don&rsquo;t Worry, They Have a Plan B<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Apple Vision Pro is a technological marvel, no doubt. But let&rsquo;s face it, that price tag is going to keep it out of reach for most people. I&rsquo;m predicting that sales will be sluggish, and Apple will start teasing a more affordable, lightweight headset that looks a lot like&hellip; you guessed it, Meta&rsquo;s Ray-Bans.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->8. Drupal Shoots for the Stars (and Lands Among Them)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Remember Drupal? That open-source content management system that powers millions of websites? Well, get ready for a Drupal renaissance. With the launch of &ldquo;Drupal Starshot,&rdquo; the platform will become more accessible and user-friendly than ever before. This means we&rsquo;ll see a resurgence of Drupal not just among expert developers, but also among junior developers and even those who prefer a low-code approach. Watch out, WordPress, Drupal&rsquo;s coming for you!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->9. Messaging Platforms Finally Start Playing Nice (Sort Of)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tired of juggling a dozen different messaging apps? You&rsquo;re not alone. In 2025, I predict we&rsquo;ll finally see some movement towards interoperability between messaging platforms. Google, Meta, Telegram, and others will start showcasing how their services can work together, making it easier to chat with friends and family no matter what app they&rsquo;re using. Don&rsquo;t expect a completely seamless experience just yet, but it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->10. Google AI Agents: Jarvis, Is That You? (And Can I Call You Jeeves?)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google&rsquo;s been quietly working on some seriously impressive AI agents, and I think 2025 will be the year they finally unleash them on the world. Imagine interacting with your devices and services in a completely natural way, like you&rsquo;re talking to Jarvis from Iron Man. &ldquo;Hey Google, make me a reservation at that new fusion restaurant downtown,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hey Google, write a blog post about my 2025 tech predictions.&rdquo; (Wait a minute&hellip;)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But here&rsquo;s the kicker: Google will finally let you personalize the &ldquo;hot word&rdquo; that triggers these AI agents. Tired of saying &ldquo;Hey Google&rdquo;? No problem. Call it Jarvis, Jeeves, Alfred, or whatever your digital heart desires. These AI agents will be so smart and intuitive, it&rsquo;ll feel like you&rsquo;ve stepped into the future – and you can customize it to your liking.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So there you have it, folks. My 2025 tech predictions. What are yours? Share your thoughts in the comments below – let&rsquo;s see <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->who has the best foresight!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

Google has just made it easier than ever to keep your precious memories. Paul Dunlop, the product lead for Android Onboarding and Android Settings at Google, recently announced that Burst Photos now transfer seamlessly when switching from iOS to Pixel.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->View on Threads<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Previously, when transferring data from an iPhone to a Pixel using Android Switch, Burst Photos were not included. This meant that users would lose the ability to select the best shot from a burst sequence after making the switch.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->With this update, all of your Burst Photos will be transferred over, whether you&rsquo;re using a cable or Wi-Fi. This means you can rest assured that you&rsquo;ll have access to your full set of burst photos, even after making the switch to Pixel.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This feature is currently only available for Pixel devices. It is unclear if or when it will be rolled out to other Android devices.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
