Instead of scientists needing tons of custom, expensive gear, the article mentions they actually used Google Pixel smartphones as part of the setup! This is pretty clever because using phones makes the whole system easier to maintain, uses less power, and shrinks the cost and size – huge wins when you&rsquo;re doing research out in the middle of the ocean. Then, the DolphinGemma AI does the heavy lifting on the sound analysis. Think of it like giving the AI a massive playlist of dolphin sounds recorded underwater. The AI listens to everything – all the clicks, whistles, and background noise. It uses clever machine learning tricks (based on Google&rsquo;s Gemma AI tech) to start picking out patterns all by itself. It learns to spot the difference between random ocean noise and actual dolphin calls, and even starts figuring out which sounds might be important.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/chat-pixel.width-1000.format-webp.webp\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A smartphone is placed inside an electronic enclosure with various connectors and a coiled wire.\"></p>\n<p>The really neat part is that DolphinGemma learns directly from the raw sound waves. It doesn&rsquo;t need humans to tell it &ldquo;this is a whistle&rdquo; or &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a click&rdquo; beforehand. It just listens and learns, kind of like how a baby learns language by hearing it all the time. This means it might catch subtle things in their calls that humans could easily miss. The goal is to get good enough to identify different types of calls and maybe even tell individual dolphins apart just by their voice! The AI&rsquo;s predictive power can also help researchers react faster during interactions, making the study more fluid.</p>\n<p>Beyond just dolphins, think about where else this kind of smart listening tech could be useful. The basic idea of teaching AI to pick out meaningful patterns in complex sounds could definitely be applied elsewhere in nature. Imagine, for instance, using something similar to better understand all the different animal sounds happening in a busy rainforest environment. It might help track hard-to-see animal populations or get a better sense of the ecosystem&rsquo;s health just by listening in.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/dolphins.width-1000.format-webp.webp\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Now, are we going to have full conversations with Flipper tomorrow? Probably not! Getting a complete &ldquo;dolphin dictionary&rdquo; is still way off. But, this DolphinGemma thing is a huge step. Understanding dolphins better could tell us so much about how they live, hang out, and how they&rsquo;re doing in the ocean. Plus, the tech they built for this could help us understand other chatty animals too. It’s pretty amazing to see AI being used to connect us more with the awesome creatures we share the planet with!</p>\n",

It doesn't need humans to tell it \"this is a whistle\" or \"that's a click\" beforehand. It just listens and learns, kind of like how a baby learns language by hearing it all the time. This means it might catch subtle things in their calls that humans could easily miss. The goal is to get good enough to identify different types of calls and maybe even tell individual dolphins apart just by their voice! The AI's predictive power can also help researchers react faster during interactions, making the study more fluid.\n\nBeyond just dolphins, think about where else this kind of smart listening tech could be useful. The basic idea of teaching AI to pick out meaningful patterns in complex sounds could definitely be applied elsewhere in nature. Imagine, for instance, using something similar to better understand all the different animal sounds happening in a busy rainforest environment. It might help track hard-to-see animal populations or get a better sense of the ecosystem's health just by listening in.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/dolphins.width-1000.format-webp.webp)\n\nNow, are we going to have full conversations with Flipper tomorrow? Probably not! Getting a complete \"dolphin dictionary\" is still way off. But, this DolphinGemma thing is a huge step. Understanding dolphins better could tell us so much about how they live, hang out, and how they're doing in the ocean. Plus, the tech they built for this could help us understand other chatty animals too. It’s pretty amazing to see AI being used to connect us more with the awesome creatures we share the planet with!\n",

The goal is systems that can truly get the intent behind a request, break down tricky problems, and work towards a goal. The potential improvements in Gemini 2.5 could start closing the gap between today&rsquo;s AI, which handles specific tasks well, and a future AI that acts more like a thinking partner.

Better reasoning also means the AI should get better at handling fuzzy language and understanding subtle meanings, which is crucial for natural interaction. The impact goes way beyond just developer tools; think about smarter information discovery in Search, more helpful automation in Workspace, and richer experiences on Android.

The focus on planning and handling multi-step tasks suggests the AI has a better internal sense of the world and can work towards a goal methodically. Instead of just reacting to the last thing said, Gemini 2.5 looks designed to map out a sequence of actions, maybe even predict roadblocks, and stick to a strategy to complete a complex user request.

That’s a much more involved and proactive partner than one just giving isolated code examples. This level of smarts demands serious computational resources, both for training the model and running it, plus clever new algorithms and efficient designs. Google DeepMind is likely using advanced techniques, possibly including sophisticated feedback loops during training that specifically reward good reasoning and planning, along with architectural tweaks for more structured thinking.

				"title": "Dear Google: Let’s Talk About the Pixel (Comments from Reddit)",
				"content_html": "<p>A 13 year long iPhone customer, finally made the switch from iPhone to the Google Pixel 9 Pro and he shared some great feedback about his experience using Pixel. Some of them are just the difference from being in a closed-ecosystem, controlled by one company and moving to a more open-ecosystem semi-controlled by one company, but with the philosophy of an open-ecosystem. If that makes sense. I provided <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jj644v/comment/mjowpaw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\">my comments</a> to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jj644v/dear_google_lets_talk_about_the_pixel/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\">the person&rsquo;s post on reddit</a>. I&rsquo;ve share them below. The original redditor&rsquo;s comments are in the green. Mine are in between. Enjoy.</p>\n<p>I love all of these suggestions and would welcome all of these, but I&rsquo;d like to share my thoughts on these. I&rsquo;ll skip the first one since that was positive feedback.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2. <strong>Improve the Tensor Chip</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make the Tensor chip as fast as the top-tier Snapdragon or the latest iPhone’s chip. I’ve noticed some lag, especially when gaming. Sure, 99% of people don’t game heavily on their phones, but when you have an iPhone, you know it can handle it if you want. That’s a feeling of security.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this is coming with time. Both Qualcomm and Apple have been making their own chips for more than a decade now. Google partnering with Samsung in their Tensor White Chapel and newer chips was to jumpstart Google&rsquo;s experience in making their own chips, while still being able to customize the and tweak the AI experience on their own devices. Similar to how Apple learned from Intel before switching to their own silicon. Overall, I think this is coming, but with a caveat. Google will more than likely rely on the combination and collaboration of Cloud computing. So raw power locally won&rsquo;t always been the focus.

But please work on getting the video quality closer to iPhone levels—especially when switching lenses mid-recording.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think you&rsquo;re right on with this and I think Google is surely advancing here.

This is crucial for everyday use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I want this to, and Google has worked with IG, Snap, and the YouTube team for a few years and has added some exclusives that aren&rsquo;t available on iOS. Like Night Sight in Instagram, Live video switching between Pixel&rsquo;s, and Live Transcribe. Still there is a lot more work that needs to be done and the CameraX API is the key.

It would simplify communication across Android ecosystem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From my understanding, it&rsquo;s the same. Messages and Facetime are two completely different apps. You can uninstall Facetime and still have Messages. I assume that when you can uninstall Messages on iOS, you can still use Facetime. I might not fully understand what you mean here, but I think they are pretty similar. I think WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal are the only ones that truly have it blended. But, AFAIK Google Meet and Google Messages are to what Apple Facetime and Apple Messages are today in terms as a seamless experience.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>7. <strong>Add Built-In Magnets</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Implement magnets inside the phone (like MagSafe on iPhone). There are tons of accessories that rely on this feature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not opposed to this, but is it absolutely needed? Most people have a case on their phone. Does the Pixel need magnets if more cases have magnets? I think that&rsquo;s up for debate. I know a lot of people like to go caseless, but anecdotally, for every caseless courageous person I see in public, I see 10 cas(r)eful cautious people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>8. <strong>Strengthen the Ecosystem</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One major reason people stick with iPhone is because of Apple’s ecosystem.

That would help lure more people in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Would native desktop apps do that? Why? To what metric? What benefit do customers get from having a native Messages app as opposed to a Web one? Web apps don&rsquo;t take up space on the local machine and web apps can be wherever you are. If the features are consistent between the two, I don&rsquo;t see the want and need for that.</p>\n<p>As for the ecosystem, I agree, and that definitely takes a lot more time because Google can&rsquo;t and probably won&rsquo;t force any OEM, Developer, etc&hellip; to do things that solely benefit Google. <a href=\"https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones\">Apple can and does do that </a>at the expense of third-party accessory makers and developers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>9. <strong>Bolster Core Android Features</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Keep improving Android at its core.

It&rsquo;s still new and getting as many Pixel Watch experiences out of the door as possibly is more important with the balance of providing premium fitness experiences. I think for Google only having made 3 watches, they&rsquo;ve done great. Remember, Samsung and Apple have had watch accessory businesses for at least 10 years. That comes with time, but Pixel is advancing at a fast pace. With all that said, I do think the Pixel Watch needs smoother animations and better loading performance.

				"content_text": "A 13 year long iPhone customer, finally made the switch from iPhone to the Google Pixel 9 Pro and he shared some great feedback about his experience using Pixel. Some of them are just the difference from being in a closed-ecosystem, controlled by one company and moving to a more open-ecosystem semi-controlled by one company, but with the philosophy of an open-ecosystem. If that makes sense. I provided [my comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jj644v/comment/mjowpaw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) to [the person's post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jj644v/dear_google_lets_talk_about_the_pixel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). I've share them below. The original redditor's comments are in the green. Mine are in between. Enjoy. \n\nI love all of these suggestions and would welcome all of these, but I'd like to share my thoughts on these. I'll skip the first one since that was positive feedback.\n\n>2. **Improve the Tensor Chip**\n\n>Make the Tensor chip as fast as the top-tier Snapdragon or the latest iPhone’s chip. I’ve noticed some lag, especially when gaming. Sure, 99% of people don’t game heavily on their phones, but when you have an iPhone, you know it can handle it if you want. That’s a feeling of security.\n\nI think this is coming with time. Both Qualcomm and Apple have been making their own chips for more than a decade now. Google partnering with Samsung in their Tensor White Chapel and newer chips was to jumpstart Google's experience in making their own chips, while still being able to customize the and tweak the AI experience on their own devices. Similar to how Apple learned from Intel before switching to their own silicon. Overall, I think this is coming, but with a caveat. Google will more than likely rely on the combination and collaboration of Cloud computing. So raw power locally won't always been the focus. Especially since it requires a whole lot more R&D, will eat into margins, and they'll more than likely raise the price of devices even more than the usual economical increases. \n\n>3. **Enhance Video Recording**\n\n>You guys take incredible photos, so keep it up. But please work on getting the video quality closer to iPhone levels—especially when switching lenses mid-recording.\n\nI think you're right on with this and I think Google is surely advancing here. Even [adding their own custom ISP](https://www.androidauthority.com/how-google-built-tensor-g5-3535489/#:~:text=The%20Tensor%20G5%20will%20have%20a%20fully%20custom%20ISP%20from%20the%20front%2Dend%20to%20the%20back%2Dend%20parts%20of%20the%20pipeline) as well as replace \"BigWave\" (Google's in-house video codec) with WAVE677DV suggesting that the latter may offer advantages in areas such as performance, power efficiency, or a combination of factors, along with the added benefit of multi-format support on the new Tensor G5 chip coming this fall. \n\n>4. **Optimize Your Own Apps**\n\n>Some Google apps are smoother on iPhone than on Pixel.

[Apple can and does do that ](https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones)at the expense of third-party accessory makers and developers. \n\n>9. **Bolster Core Android Features**\n\n>Keep improving Android at its core. Make it even more robust, smooth, and user-friendly.\n\nNo notes. This is good. Progression is good. \n\n>10. **Elevate the Watch Experience**\n\n>The Pixel Watch needs more attention.

Managers had no choice in the matter, according to a former search employee: Bard took precedence over everything else. Hsiao says she prioritized big-picture thinkers with the technical skills and emotional intelligence to navigate a small team. Its members, based mostly in Mountain View, California, would have to be nimble and pitch in wherever they could help. “You’re Team Bard,” Hsiao told them. “You wear all the hats.”</p>\n<p>In January 2023, Pichai announced the first mass layoffs in the company’s history—12,000 jobs, about 7 percent of the workforce. “No one knew what exactly to do to be safe going forward,” says a former engineering manager. Some employees worried that if they didn’t put in overtime, they would quickly lose their jobs. If that meant disrupting kids’ bedtime routines to join Team Bard’s evening meetings, so be it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I remember, not long ago, when Bard was announced and feeling like Google was being left behind. Bard felt safe and rushed and plenty of people were calling OpenAIs ChatGPT the next Google if not just <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/10ikwm2/will_chatgpt_eventually_replace_google_search/?rdt=37110\">fully replacing Google</a>. Reading through this profile proves to me that OpenAI being the new player in the game of innovation, not having as much guardrails, was perfect for Google to ignite competition within their walls.</p>\n<p>Josh Woodward, lead on Google Labs, explains the vigor within Google:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;AROUND 6:30 ONE evening in March 2024, two Google employees showed up at Josh Woodward’s desk in the yellow zone of Gradient Canopy. Woodward leads Google Labs, a rapid-launch unit charged with turning research into entirely new products, and the employees were eager for him to hear what they had created. Using transcripts of UK Parliament hearings and the Gemini model with long context, they had generated a podcast called Westminster Watch with two AI hosts, Kath and Simon. The episode opened with Simon speaking in a cheery British accent: “It’s been another lively week in the House, with plenty of drama, debate, and even a dash of history.” Woodward was riveted. Afterward, he says, he went around telling everyone about it, including Pichai.</p>\n<p>The text-to-podcast tool, known as NotebookLM Audio Overviews, was added to the lineup for that May’s Google I/O conference. A core team worked around the clock, nights and weekends, to get it ready, Woodward told WIRED. “I mean, they literally have listened at this point to thousands and thousands” of AI-generated podcasts, he said.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I personally thought NotebookLM was incredibly impressive when I was in attendance at I/O 2024. It felt like Google Duplex, but on steroids. It felt like Google had been woken up from a slumber of complacency and lack of competition really gunning for them. Just looking at their <a href=\"https://ai.google/advancing-ai/milestones/?section=gnome\">AI Journey</a> page shows just how quickly things ramped up after 2021. I think Google is still just getting started. My prediction is that within these next two years, Google is going to ship even more fleshed out products across their Platform and Services team.</p>\n",

Some employees worried that if they didn’t put in overtime, they would quickly lose their jobs. If that meant disrupting kids’ bedtime routines to join Team Bard’s evening meetings, so be it.\n\nI remember, not long ago, when Bard was announced and feeling like Google was being left behind. Bard felt safe and rushed and plenty of people were calling OpenAIs ChatGPT the next Google if not just [fully replacing Google](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/10ikwm2/will_chatgpt_eventually_replace_google_search/?rdt=37110). Reading through this profile proves to me that OpenAI being the new player in the game of innovation, not having as much guardrails, was perfect for Google to ignite competition within their walls.  \n\nJosh Woodward, lead on Google Labs, explains the vigor within Google: \n\n> \"AROUND 6:30 ONE evening in March 2024, two Google employees showed up at Josh Woodward’s desk in the yellow zone of Gradient Canopy. Woodward leads Google Labs, a rapid-launch unit charged with turning research into entirely new products, and the employees were eager for him to hear what they had created. Using transcripts of UK Parliament hearings and the Gemini model with long context, they had generated a podcast called Westminster Watch with two AI hosts, Kath and Simon. The episode opened with Simon speaking in a cheery British accent: “It’s been another lively week in the House, with plenty of drama, debate, and even a dash of history.” Woodward was riveted. Afterward, he says, he went around telling everyone about it, including Pichai.\n>\n> The text-to-podcast tool, known as NotebookLM Audio Overviews, was added to the lineup for that May’s Google I/O conference. A core team worked around the clock, nights and weekends, to get it ready, Woodward told WIRED. “I mean, they literally have listened at this point to thousands and thousands” of AI-generated podcasts, he said.\"\n\nI personally thought NotebookLM was incredibly impressive when I was in attendance at I/O 2024. It felt like Google Duplex, but on steroids. It felt like Google had been woken up from a slumber of complacency and lack of competition really gunning for them. Just looking at their [AI Journey](https://ai.google/advancing-ai/milestones/?section=gnome) page shows just how quickly things ramped up after 2021. I think Google is still just getting started. My prediction is that within these next two years, Google is going to ship even more fleshed out products across their Platform and Services team. \n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve always appreciated the flexibility of Android. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve switched between Android and iPhone, and back to Android, and I&rsquo;ve noticed consistent issues within the iPhone experience that ultimately led me back to Android. A recent <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1jasi0m/switched_from_pixel_7_to_iphone_16_pro_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\">Reddit post from u/Pucky22</a>, who switched from a Pixel 7 to an iPhone 16 Pro, echoes many of my own experiences. The post provides a detailed look at the pros and cons of switching to iPhone after being a long-time Android user. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the user&rsquo;s observations, and my own perspective.</p>\n<h1 id=\"analyzing-the-good\">Analyzing &ldquo;The Good&rdquo;</h1>\n<p>Pucky22 highlighting several positive aspects of the iPhone 16 Pro:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hardware Quality</strong>: A really nice piece of hardware. Beautiful, solid, and feels great in hand. The Pro model is a good size—big but not too bulky.</p>\n<p><strong>Screen</strong>: Looks fantastic. No complaints.</p>\n<p><strong>Camera &amp; Video</strong>: Takes excellent shots, and from all accounts, the video quality is top-tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic Island</strong>: First time hearing about it, but it’s actually pretty cool. Having sports scores and music controls right there is surprisingly useful.</p>\n<p><strong>Software Touches</strong>: Some effects and animations are really smooth—like when scanning a document, it isolates the background and seamlessly moves it into the corner.</p>\n<p><strong>CarPlay</strong>: This surprised me. When catching up on notifications, it gives a natural-language summary of missed messages, which is really nice.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Apple Maps</strong> navigation voice and style is very natural and smooth—I actually prefer it to Google Maps. I guess the days of being navigated into a lake are over for Apple Maps!</p>\n<p><strong>Grouped Notifications</strong>: While I still think Android does notifications better, Apple’s grouping and summarization of same-app notifications is intelligently designed and useful.</p>\n<p><strong>FaceID</strong>: When you’re holding the phone, FaceID works perfectly—fast and accurate. However, if the phone is sitting on a desk or table, FaceID often won’t pick up your face unless you awkwardly lean over it. A fingerprint reader would be a really nice option in those situations.</p>\n<p><strong>Standby Mode</strong>: Standby mode at night, with the bedside alarm clock in red, was actually very nice and well-designed. It’s subtle but easy to read at night without being harsh on the eyes. Also, the default iPhone alarm tone is exceptionally pleasing—way better than the jarring tones I’m used to on Android.</p>\n<p><strong>GenMoji Seems Fun</strong>: I didn’t even try it once, but I bet it’s cool for those who are into that sort of thing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pucky22 praised the iPhone&rsquo;s hardware, display, and camera, and found features like Dynamic Island and CarPlay&rsquo;s notification summaries to be surprisingly useful. They also noted the smooth software animations, improved Apple Maps, and well-designed Standby Mode. All of those to which I also share the same sentiment.</p>\n<h1 id=\"analyzing-the-bad\">Analyzing &ldquo;The Bad&rdquo;</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, the user&rsquo;s experience wasn&rsquo;t entirely positive. The user encountered several significant issues with iOS.</p>\n<p>These aren’t new complaints about iOS, but for someone using it as a main device, they are massive hurdles.</p>\n<p><strong>The Keyboard is Borderline Unusable</strong>. Whether using the stock keyboard or Gboard on iOS, the experience is awful. So many typos, wrong key presses—it’s just bad. The Gboard on my old Pixel 7 was 1000x more accurate and faster to type on. It has been consistently infuriating. I had no idea just how much better the Android keyboard was.</p>\n<p><strong>Notifications = Anxiety Machine</strong>. iPhone is aggressive with notifications—way more than I was used to. On Android, you can easily choose which notifications for a given app should be silent or not, right from the notification itself—just a quick tap and done. On iPhone, it’s a much more laborious process, requiring you to dig into settings manually for each app. This makes it way harder to fine-tune notifications to be useful instead of overwhelming.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of Settings…</strong> Why is there a whole app called “Settings” instead of just swiping down and tapping an icon to adjust things quickly? Having to navigate through an app for simple things like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is an unnecessary step.</p>\n<p><strong>No App Drawer</strong>. This is insane. Instead of a clean app drawer, you have to either search for apps (which is fine but not intuitive) or look through Apple&rsquo;s pre-made categories in the App Library. The grouping seems neat at first glance but ends up being a wild choice in actual use. Why do I have to rely on Apple to decide where my apps go?</p>\n<p><strong>CarPlay Layout is a Mess</strong>. Apple Maps is actually pretty solid now—natural-sounding navigation, accurate directions—but the overall CarPlay interface is clunky compared to Android Auto.If you use Google Maps on CarPlay (without a car screen, just on your phone), you can only get in-app media controls for Spotify or Apple Music—not YouTube Music.

				"content_text": "I've always appreciated the flexibility of Android. Over the years, I've switched between Android and iPhone, and back to Android, and I've noticed consistent issues within the iPhone experience that ultimately led me back to Android. A recent [Reddit post from u/Pucky22](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1jasi0m/switched_from_pixel_7_to_iphone_16_pro_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), who switched from a Pixel 7 to an iPhone 16 Pro, echoes many of my own experiences. The post provides a detailed look at the pros and cons of switching to iPhone after being a long-time Android user. Here's a breakdown of the user's observations, and my own perspective.\n\n# Analyzing \"The Good\"\n\nPucky22 highlighting several positive aspects of the iPhone 16 Pro: \n\n> **Hardware Quality**: A really nice piece of hardware. Beautiful, solid, and feels great in hand. The Pro model is a good size—big but not too bulky.\n> \n> **Screen**: Looks fantastic. No complaints.\n> \n> **Camera & Video**: Takes excellent shots, and from all accounts, the video quality is top-tier.\n> \n> **Dynamic Island**: First time hearing about it, but it’s actually pretty cool. Having sports scores and music controls right there is surprisingly useful.\n> \n> **Software Touches**: Some effects and animations are really smooth—like when scanning a document, it isolates the background and seamlessly moves it into the corner.\n> \n> **CarPlay**: This surprised me. When catching up on notifications, it gives a natural-language summary of missed messages, which is really nice.\n> \n> The **Apple Maps** navigation voice and style is very natural and smooth—I actually prefer it to Google Maps. I guess the days of being navigated into a lake are over for Apple Maps!\n> \n> **Grouped Notifications**: While I still think Android does notifications better, Apple’s grouping and summarization of same-app notifications is intelligently designed and useful.\n> \n> **FaceID**: When you’re holding the phone, FaceID works perfectly—fast and accurate. However, if the phone is sitting on a desk or table, FaceID often won’t pick up your face unless you awkwardly lean over it. A fingerprint reader would be a really nice option in those situations.\n> \n> **Standby Mode**: Standby mode at night, with the bedside alarm clock in red, was actually very nice and well-designed. It’s subtle but easy to read at night without being harsh on the eyes. Also, the default iPhone alarm tone is exceptionally pleasing—way better than the jarring tones I’m used to on Android.\n> \n> **GenMoji Seems Fun**: I didn’t even try it once, but I bet it’s cool for those who are into that sort of thing.\n\nPucky22 praised the iPhone's hardware, display, and camera, and found features like Dynamic Island and CarPlay's notification summaries to be surprisingly useful. They also noted the smooth software animations, improved Apple Maps, and well-designed Standby Mode. All of those to which I also share the same sentiment.\n\n# Analyzing \"The Bad\"\n\n> However, the user's experience wasn't entirely positive. The user encountered several significant issues with iOS.\n>\n> These aren’t new complaints about iOS, but for someone using it as a main device, they are massive hurdles.\n> \n> **The Keyboard is Borderline Unusable**. Whether using the stock keyboard or Gboard on iOS, the experience is awful. So many typos, wrong key presses—it’s just bad. The Gboard on my old Pixel 7 was 1000x more accurate and faster to type on. It has been consistently infuriating. I had no idea just how much better the Android keyboard was.\n> \n> **Notifications = Anxiety Machine**. iPhone is aggressive with notifications—way more than I was used to. On Android, you can easily choose which notifications for a given app should be silent or not, right from the notification itself—just a quick tap and done. On iPhone, it’s a much more laborious process, requiring you to dig into settings manually for each app. This makes it way harder to fine-tune notifications to be useful instead of overwhelming.\n> \n> **Speaking of Settings…** Why is there a whole app called “Settings” instead of just swiping down and tapping an icon to adjust things quickly? Having to navigate through an app for simple things like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is an unnecessary step.\n> \n> **No App Drawer**. This is insane. Instead of a clean app drawer, you have to either search for apps (which is fine but not intuitive) or look through Apple's pre-made categories in the App Library. The grouping seems neat at first glance but ends up being a wild choice in actual use. Why do I have to rely on Apple to decide where my apps go?\n> \n> **CarPlay Layout is a Mess**. Apple Maps is actually pretty solid now—natural-sounding navigation, accurate directions—but the overall CarPlay interface is clunky compared to Android Auto.If you use Google Maps on CarPlay (without a car screen, just on your phone), you can only get in-app media controls for Spotify or Apple Music—not YouTube Music. Why??\n> \n> **iMessage is Seriously Underwhelming**. I was expecting more. RCS on Android does the same thing (minus the blue bubble “exclusivity”), so the fact that Apple has built an entire bullying ecosystem around this feels ridiculous. WhatsApp does all of this and works across devices.\n> \n> **No iMessage on a PC?** This was a shock. I use a PC for work, and I was stunned to realize that iMessage has no web or Windows version. With Google Messages, WhatsApp, or basically any other modern messaging platform, I could just open a browser and continue conversations while working. With iPhone? Nope. Either use a Mac or be stuck switching between my phone and computer constantly.\n> \n> **Transferring Old Messages From Android Was a Nightmare**. This was infuriating. There’s no native way to do it, so I had to try a third-party, expensive app—and even that still didn’t work.\n> \n> **Homescreen Organization is a Disaster**. On Android, I can place apps and widgets where I want—maybe I have a family photo as my wallpaper and don’t want anything covering faces. On iPhone? Move one app and the whole homescreen shifts like a chaotic game of Tetris. If you try to put an app in a folder, it’s like chasing a toddler at bedtime. Just… why?\n\nPucky22's experience highlights the strengths and weaknesses of switching to iOS from Android, and mirrors my own experiences.

				"content_html": "<h2 id=\"googles-daily-listen-your-discover-feed-now-in-audio\">Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;Daily Listen&rdquo;: Your Discover Feed, Now in Audio</h2>\n<p>Google is constantly experimenting with ways to make information more accessible and digestible. The latest foray into this arena comes in the form of &ldquo;Daily Listen,&rdquo; an experimental feature tucked away in Google Discover within Google&rsquo;s Search Labs. Imagine transforming your personalized Discover feed into a short, easily consumable audio podcast – that&rsquo;s the core concept behind Daily Listen.\r\rHere&rsquo;s a quick breakdown of &ldquo;What it is&rdquo;, &ldquo;How it works&rdquo;, and &ldquo;How Pixel customers can use it&rdquo;:\r\r* <strong>What it is:</strong>\r\r    * It&rsquo;s an AI-powered audio experience that provides a brief, roughly five-minute summary of the topics you&rsquo;re interested in, based directly on your Google Discover feed. Think of it as a personalized news bulletin curated by your own browsing habits.\r    * Essentially, it&rsquo;s an audio version of your Discover feed, perfect for catching up on the go, during your commute, or while multitasking. I&rsquo;ve personally found that these small, bite-sized, consumable podcasts are incredibly useful. Services like &ldquo;Daily Listen&rdquo; fulfill that niche of providing just enough information without the fluff that often bogs down longer-form content. Look at the success of podcasts like TechMeme Ride Home and even the long-running &ldquo;MacOS Ken&rdquo; - concise, informative briefings are a real win.\r\r* <strong>How it works:</strong>\r\r    * It uses AI to gather and summarize content from your Discover feed, creating a personalized podcast episode. The magic goes deeper than simple text-to-speech. The AI is likely leveraging techniques like:\r        * <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> To understand the core themes and key arguments within the articles in your feed.\r        * <strong>Summarization Algorithms:</strong> To condense longer articles into concise and digestible snippets, capturing the essence of the information.\r        * <strong>Topic Modeling:</strong> To identify recurring themes and group related content, ensuring the audio episode is coherent and well-structured.\r        * <strong>Voice Cloning or Text-to-Speech (TTS) with Style Transfer:</strong> Although not confirmed, it is possible Google is experimenting with using voice cloning to produce more natural sounding &ldquo;Daily Listen&rdquo; content, potentially with subtle inflections based on the tone of the original article. Another possibility is employing style transfer to adjust the TTS&rsquo;s pitch and tone for a more human-like reading, instead of a robotic one.\r    * The content selection is based on your search history and interactions with the Discover feed. This means the algorithm considers:\r        * <strong>Keywords in your searches:</strong> What you&rsquo;ve actively looked for provides explicit signals about your interests.\r        * <strong>Websites you frequently visit:</strong> If you&rsquo;re a regular reader of a particular news site or blog, content from that source is more likely to appear.\r        * <strong>Topics you&rsquo;ve engaged with in Discover:</strong> Articles you&rsquo;ve clicked on, shared, or saved are strong indicators of your preferences.\r        * <strong>Feedback you&rsquo;ve provided:</strong> Clicking &ldquo;More like this&rdquo; or &ldquo;Less like this&rdquo; on Discover cards directly influences future content recommendations.\r\r    * <strong>Technical Analysis Considerations:</strong> The back-end likely utilizes a combination of Google&rsquo;s existing AI infrastructure, possibly leveraging TensorFlow or similar frameworks. The system would need to continuously monitor and update your profile of interests in real-time, re-running the summarization and aggregation algorithms each time a new Daily Listen is generated. This necessitates significant computational power and optimized algorithms to deliver the five-minute summary efficiently. Furthermore, the system would require efficient caching mechanisms to prevent redundant processing for users with relatively stable browsing habits.\r* <strong>How Pixel customers can use it:</strong>\r\r    * First, users must opt-in to Search Labs within the Google app. Open the Google app, tap your profile picture, go to &ldquo;Settings,&rdquo; then &ldquo;Search Labs,&rdquo; and enable &ldquo;Daily Listen.&rdquo;\r    * Once enabled, a &ldquo;Daily Listen&rdquo; card will appear in the Discover feed. The appearance and frequency of this card may vary depending on the availability of relevant content and the algorithm&rsquo;s confidence in its relevance to your interests.\r    * Tapping the card generates the personalized audio episode. The AI then springs into action, compiling and narrating the audio summary.\r    * The user will then have audio control functions, such as pause, rewind, and fast forward, allowing for a user-friendly and adaptable listening experience.\r\r<strong>Daily Listen and the Potential Connection to Notebook LM:</strong>\r\rWhile not explicitly stated, it&rsquo;s intriguing to consider the potential relationship between Daily Listen and Google&rsquo;s Notebook LM (formerly Project Tailwind). Notebook LM is Google&rsquo;s AI-powered note-taking tool that summarizes, analyzes, and generates insights from uploaded documents. The core summarization technology powering Daily Listen could be a direct application, or at least a close relative, of the same AI models used in Notebook LM.\r\rHere&rsquo;s why:\r\r* <strong>Shared Summarization Capabilities:</strong> Both Daily Listen and Notebook LM rely heavily on AI-powered summarization. The same algorithms that condense lengthy research papers in Notebook LM could be adapted to summarize news articles in Daily Listen.\r* <strong>Understanding Context and Theme:</strong> Notebook LM is designed to understand the context and key themes within complex documents. This understanding is crucial for creating accurate and informative summaries, a skill directly applicable to the Daily Listen feature.\r* <strong>Potential for Personalized Learning:</strong> Imagine a future where you can upload your own articles, research papers, or meeting notes to Notebook LM, then have Daily Listen create a personalized audio summary of <em>your</em> content. This could be a powerful tool for learning, staying organized, and retaining information.\r\rGoogle&rsquo;s &ldquo;Daily Listen&rdquo; is more than just a fun experimental feature; it represents a powerful application of AI to personalize information consumption. Still in its early stages, the underlying technology, potentially connected to advancements in tools like Notebook LM, suggests a future where AI-powered audio summaries become a commonplace way to stay informed and engaged.\r<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/bedc0f97a4.jpg\" alt=\"A smartphone displays a Google search screen with various widgets and app icons, including a Daily Listen\" widget highlighted by a red arrow.\"></p>\n",

The AI then springs into action, compiling and narrating the audio summary.\r    * The user will then have audio control functions, such as pause, rewind, and fast forward, allowing for a user-friendly and adaptable listening experience.\r\r**Daily Listen and the Potential Connection to Notebook LM:**\r\rWhile not explicitly stated, it's intriguing to consider the potential relationship between Daily Listen and Google's Notebook LM (formerly Project Tailwind). Notebook LM is Google's AI-powered note-taking tool that summarizes, analyzes, and generates insights from uploaded documents. The core summarization technology powering Daily Listen could be a direct application, or at least a close relative, of the same AI models used in Notebook LM.\r\rHere's why:\r\r* **Shared Summarization Capabilities:** Both Daily Listen and Notebook LM rely heavily on AI-powered summarization. The same algorithms that condense lengthy research papers in Notebook LM could be adapted to summarize news articles in Daily Listen.\r* **Understanding Context and Theme:** Notebook LM is designed to understand the context and key themes within complex documents. This understanding is crucial for creating accurate and informative summaries, a skill directly applicable to the Daily Listen feature.\r* **Potential for Personalized Learning:** Imagine a future where you can upload your own articles, research papers, or meeting notes to Notebook LM, then have Daily Listen create a personalized audio summary of *your* content. This could be a powerful tool for learning, staying organized, and retaining information.\r\rGoogle's \"Daily Listen\" is more than just a fun experimental feature; it represents a powerful application of AI to personalize information consumption. Still in its early stages, the underlying technology, potentially connected to advancements in tools like Notebook LM, suggests a future where AI-powered audio summaries become a commonplace way to stay informed and engaged.\r![A smartphone displays a Google search screen with various widgets and app icons, including a Daily Listen\" widget highlighted by a red arrow.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/bedc0f97a4.jpg)\n",

Only in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22864892/google-2022-ecosystem-android-chromebook-ces-features\">the last three years</a> have they even <em>attempted</em> to wrangle their disparate hardware, software, cloud, and AI efforts into a coherent whole. Too little, too late? Perhaps.

He&rsquo;s managed to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24133881/google-android-pixel-teams-reorg-rick-osterloh\">corral the Platform and Services division</a>. Yet, the ecosystem still feels… scattered. The Pixel hardware, for all its promise, still reeks of a <a href=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/02/24/googles-pixels-are-apples-tvs.html\">&lsquo;side project&rsquo;</a>—a lavish, expensive, and perpetually unfinished side project. The pieces are there, scattered across the table. Can Google finally assemble the puzzle, or will they forever be a company of impressive parts, but no cohesive whole?</p>\n<p>After over a decade of observing Google&rsquo;s trajectory, certain patterns emerge. Chromebooks (bless their budget-friendly hearts), for instance, have settled comfortably into the budget lane: affordable laptops for grade schoolers and retirees. <em>Hardly</em> the &lsquo;sexy&rsquo; category Apple&rsquo;s M-series or those Windows CoPilot ARM machines occupy, <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-plus-google/\">is it</a>? Google&rsquo;s Nest, meanwhile, <em>envisioned</em> ambient computing years ago. Yet,<a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@panospanay/post/DG1DrgAypzL?xmt=AQGzS9MJYFBSnLZhfQRrSs7yxSRdj2F7kUbefTchTVf86Q\"> Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa+ seems to be delivering</a> on that promise while Google&rsquo;s vision gathers dust. And let&rsquo;s talk apps: Google&rsquo;s own, some of the most popular on both Android and iOS, often <em>perform better on iOS</em>. Yes, that&rsquo;s changing—slowly. And the messaging app graveyard? Overblown, some say. I say, try herding a family group chat through Google&rsquo;s ever-shifting messaging landscape. Musical chairs, indeed. But, credit where it&rsquo;s due, Google Messages is finally showing some long-term commitment. Perhaps the ghosts of Hangouts and Allo are finally resting in peace.</p>\n<p>The long view, after thirteen years of observing Google&rsquo;s sprawling ambitions, reveals a complex picture: immense potential, yet a frustrating pattern of fragmented execution. They&rsquo;ve built impressive pieces—the AI, the cloud, the hardware—but the promised cohesive ecosystem has remained elusive. Whispers of &ldquo;Pixel Sense,&rdquo; Google&rsquo;s rumored answer to true AI integration, offer a glimmer of hope. (And let&rsquo;s be clear, these are <em>just</em> rumors—I&rsquo;m not grading on a curve here.) But, after years of watching disjointed efforts, I find myself cautiously optimistic about the direction Rick Osterloh (knowledgeable, and, some might say, charming) and his newly unified Platform and Services division are taking. There&rsquo;s a sense that, finally, the pieces might be coming together. The vision of a seamlessly integrated Google experience—hardware, software, AI, and cloud—is tantalizingly close. Will they finally deliver? Or will Google continue to be a company of impressive tech demos and unfulfilled promises? Time will tell. But for the first time in a long time, I&rsquo;m willing to entertain the possibility that Google might just pull it off.</p>\n",

The Pixel hardware, for all its promise, still reeks of a ['side project'](https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/02/24/googles-pixels-are-apples-tvs.html)—a lavish, expensive, and perpetually unfinished side project. The pieces are there, scattered across the table. Can Google finally assemble the puzzle, or will they forever be a company of impressive parts, but no cohesive whole?\n\n\n\n\nAfter over a decade of observing Google's trajectory, certain patterns emerge. Chromebooks (bless their budget-friendly hearts), for instance, have settled comfortably into the budget lane: affordable laptops for grade schoolers and retirees. *Hardly* the 'sexy' category Apple's M-series or those Windows CoPilot ARM machines occupy, [is it](https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-plus-google/)? Google's Nest, meanwhile, *envisioned* ambient computing years ago. Yet,[ Amazon's Alexa+ seems to be delivering](https://www.threads.net/@panospanay/post/DG1DrgAypzL?xmt=AQGzS9MJYFBSnLZhfQRrSs7yxSRdj2F7kUbefTchTVf86Q) on that promise while Google's vision gathers dust. And let's talk apps: Google's own, some of the most popular on both Android and iOS, often *perform better on iOS*. Yes, that's changing—slowly. And the messaging app graveyard? Overblown, some say. I say, try herding a family group chat through Google's ever-shifting messaging landscape. Musical chairs, indeed. But, credit where it's due, Google Messages is finally showing some long-term commitment. Perhaps the ghosts of Hangouts and Allo are finally resting in peace.\n\n\n\n\nThe long view, after thirteen years of observing Google's sprawling ambitions, reveals a complex picture: immense potential, yet a frustrating pattern of fragmented execution. They've built impressive pieces—the AI, the cloud, the hardware—but the promised cohesive ecosystem has remained elusive. Whispers of \"Pixel Sense,\" Google's rumored answer to true AI integration, offer a glimmer of hope. (And let's be clear, these are *just* rumors—I'm not grading on a curve here.) But, after years of watching disjointed efforts, I find myself cautiously optimistic about the direction Rick Osterloh (knowledgeable, and, some might say, charming) and his newly unified Platform and Services division are taking. There's a sense that, finally, the pieces might be coming together. The vision of a seamlessly integrated Google experience—hardware, software, AI, and cloud—is tantalizingly close. Will they finally deliver? Or will Google continue to be a company of impressive tech demos and unfulfilled promises? Time will tell. But for the first time in a long time, I'm willing to entertain the possibility that Google might just pull it off.\n",

Just when we thought things couldn&rsquo;t get more embarrassing than delaying &ldquo;Apple Intelligence,&rdquo; we get this gem. <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@gruber/114127816716893319\"> John Gruber, over on Mastodon,</a> shared a screenshot of his recent conversation with Siri, and let&rsquo;s just say it&rsquo;s not a good look:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>MacOS 15.3.1. Asked Siri “How do you turn off suggestions in Messages?”</p>\n<p>Siri responds with instructions that:</p>\n<p>(a) Tell me to go to a System Settings panel that doesn&rsquo;t exist. There is no “Siri &amp; Spotlight”. There is “Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri&quot; and a separate one for “Spotlight”.</p>\n<p>(b) Are for Mail, not Messages, even though I asked about Messages, and Siri&rsquo;s own response starts with “To turn off Siri suggestions in Messages”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gruber simply asked Siri how to turn off suggestions in Messages on his MacOS 15.3.1.  Siri, in its infinite wisdom, first sent him on a wild goose chase to a non-existent &ldquo;Siri &amp; Spotlight&rdquo; panel in System Settings.  Then, it proceeded to give him instructions for <em>Mail</em>, not Messages!</p>\n<p>This is beyond a simple bug; it&rsquo;s a fundamental failure in understanding basic user requests.  And remember, this is the same Siri that Apple wants us to believe is the foundation for their upcoming &ldquo;Apple Intelligence&rdquo; revolution.</p>\n<p>Gruber himself pointed out the irony, highlighting how Apple touted &ldquo;product knowledge&rdquo; as a key feature of their AI, yet Siri can&rsquo;t even navigate its own settings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Product knowledge” is one of the Apple Intelligence Siri features that, in its statement yesterday, Apple touted as a success. But what I asked here is a very simple question, about an Apple Intelligence feature in one of Apple&rsquo;s most-used apps, and it turns out Siri doesn&rsquo;t even know the names of its own settings panels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s becoming increasingly clear that Apple&rsquo;s AI ambitions have outpaced their reality.  This latest Siri stumble, coupled with the<a href=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/03/07/mark-gurman-exposes-apple-intelligence.html\"> &ldquo;Apple Intelligence&rdquo; delay</a>, paints a picture of a company struggling to keep up in the AI race.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s time for Apple to take a step back, focus on getting the basics right, and then, maybe then, they can start talking about revolutionizing our AI experience.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

There is “Apple Intelligence & Siri\" and a separate one for “Spotlight”.\r\n>\r\n> (b) Are for Mail, not Messages, even though I asked about Messages, and Siri's own response starts with “To turn off Siri suggestions in Messages”\r\n\r\nGruber simply asked Siri how to turn off suggestions in Messages on his MacOS 15.3.1.  Siri, in its infinite wisdom, first sent him on a wild goose chase to a non-existent \"Siri & Spotlight\" panel in System Settings.  Then, it proceeded to give him instructions for *Mail*, not Messages! \r\n\r\nThis is beyond a simple bug; it's a fundamental failure in understanding basic user requests.  And remember, this is the same Siri that Apple wants us to believe is the foundation for their upcoming \"Apple Intelligence\" revolution.  \r\n\r\nGruber himself pointed out the irony, highlighting how Apple touted \"product knowledge\" as a key feature of their AI, yet Siri can't even navigate its own settings.  \r\n\r\n> “Product knowledge” is one of the Apple Intelligence Siri features that, in its statement yesterday, Apple touted as a success. But what I asked here is a very simple question, about an Apple Intelligence feature in one of Apple's most-used apps, and it turns out Siri doesn't even know the names of its own settings panels.\r\n\r\nIt's becoming increasingly clear that Apple's AI ambitions have outpaced their reality.  This latest Siri stumble, coupled with the[ \"Apple Intelligence\" delay](https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/03/07/mark-gurman-exposes-apple-intelligence.html), paints a picture of a company struggling to keep up in the AI race.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps it's time for Apple to take a step back, focus on getting the basics right, and then, maybe then, they can start talking about revolutionizing our AI experience.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/apple-intelligence-general-feature.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\">\n",

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://docs.bsky.app/blog/2025-protocol-roadmap-spring\">Bluesky has just unveiled its 2025 roadmap for the AT Protocol</a>, outlining some pretty significant changes aimed at making the platform smoother and more secure. Essentially, they&rsquo;re fine-tuning the entire system. A key focus is on streamlining data synchronization with the Sync v1.1 update, which will make running relays more efficient and clarify the process for validating the firehose. Think of it as optimizing the backbone of the network, ensuring everything runs smoothly. As someone who&rsquo;s been exploring both AT Protocol and ActivityPub clients, I&rsquo;m particularly interested in seeing how these improvements will help bridge the gap towards a truly functional fediverse. Currently, ActivityPub boasts a larger ecosystem of clients and more established connectivity.</p>\n<p>Security is also a major priority, with the introduction of Auth Scopes. This feature will give users much more granular control over app permissions. For example, you’ll be able to allow an app to read your posts without granting access to your direct messages. It’s about putting you firmly in the driver&rsquo;s seat when it comes to your data. Developers are getting some love too, with a new web interface for PDS account management. This will simplify the process of building apps on the AT Protocol, making it easier for new users to sign up and manage their accounts.</p>\n<p>Bluesky is also prioritizing the development of features for <strong>private groups</strong> and <strong>encrypted messages</strong>. They’re aiming to enable users to share content with specific audiences and keep it truly private, addressing a major demand for enhanced privacy. They’re also cleaning up the protocol by deprecating older features, ensuring everyone is using the latest and most efficient tools.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We believe that robust support for group-private data will be necessary for the long-term success of the protocol (and for apps built on the protocol). Similarly, the ability to share private content with a specific group or audience continues to be a top feature request for both the AT Protocol and the Bluesky app. Just as we’re currently doing with public conversation on the Bluesky app and the AT Protocol, we also want to co-design the protocol specification for private data in tandem with specific real-world product features: this results in better outcomes for both. Designing for privacy is pretty different from designing for global broadcast, and we think the data architecture will probably look pretty different from the MST + firehose system.</p>\n<p>Shared data will depend on Auth Scopes, and we don&rsquo;t expect to start design work until that is complete.</p>\n<p>Looking forward, we continue to have plans to implement on-protocol DMs and E2EE group chat. However, we don’t expect to start work on this until after shared data is implemented. Meanwhile, there has been exciting progress in the broader tech world around the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) standard, and we are optimistic that we will be able to build on reusable components and design patterns when the time comes. It is also possible (and exciting!) that the atproto dev community will experiment and build E2EE chat apps off-protocol before there is an official specification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The AT Protocol community continues to grow rapidly, and Bluesky encourages everyone to get involved through GitHub discussions and community events. It’s a collaborative effort, and the company is clearly committed to building a robust and user-friendly decentralized social network.

This Pixel-exclusive feature detects conversation patterns in calls commonly used by scammers in real time and will notify you if it senses anything suspicious.</p>\n<p>And Scam Detection is now available in Google Messages, too.

				"content_html": "<p>Online dating has become commonplace. For some Android users, the initial exchange of phone numbers or text messages can be a source of anxiety, as some Apple iPhone users, even in 2025, may hold prejudices against Android devices. When that infamous green bubble appears on an iPhone, some iPhone users are conditioned to disdain the sender, regardless of the prior conversation&rsquo;s quality or the individual&rsquo;s profile appeal. Gen Z members of my production team have explicitly stated that they would decline to date an individual solely based on their use of an Android phone, irrespective of other positive qualities.</p>\n<p>This issue is largely confined to North America, prompting <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Iw-Yg7syOaM?si=2QwqQ0ZzKpuTOIXL\">Google to enlist Keke Palmer</a> for a campaign addressing this prejudice during the recent Valentine&rsquo;s Day. The ad begins with a man preparing to respond to a &ldquo;Heyyyyy&rdquo; text from &ldquo;Sarah.&rdquo; The display clearly indicates &ldquo;RCS chat with Sarah&rdquo; and &ldquo;RCS Message,&rdquo; highlighting the use of Rich Communication Services. The ad emphasizes the ability to send reactions and high-resolution images, features previously unavailable between Android and iPhone. Notably, KeKe Palmer dismisses the man&rsquo;s concern about Sarah being an iPhone user being a problem with an eye roll, mirroring the sentiments of my Gen Z team members.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a peculiar dynamic, and Google&rsquo;s investment in educating consumers about the benefits of RCS is commendable. I wonder if Google might further amplify this message by showcasing couples like my wife and me, who found and maintain a loving relationship despite our differing phone preferences. My wife, an iPhone user, expresses a desire to switch to a Pixel, but is hindered by her iMessage group chats.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this &ldquo;green bubble&rdquo; bias reveals a deeper societal issue: a tendency to judge others based on superficial technological choices. In a world increasingly reliant on digital connections, it&rsquo;s worth considering the limitations we inadvertently impose through brand loyalty and platform preferences. Google&rsquo;s campaign, while lighthearted, serves as a timely reminder to embrace inclusivity, even in our texting habits. After all, meaningful connections transcend the color of a chat bubble.</p>\n<p>I hope that in the future, judging someone based on their phone choice will become as antiquated as using a rotary phone. I have to ask, are these ads working?</p>\n",

The ad emphasizes the ability to send reactions and high-resolution images, features previously unavailable between Android and iPhone. Notably, KeKe Palmer dismisses the man's concern about Sarah being an iPhone user being a problem with an eye roll, mirroring the sentiments of my Gen Z team members.\n\nIt's a peculiar dynamic, and Google's investment in educating consumers about the benefits of RCS is commendable. I wonder if Google might further amplify this message by showcasing couples like my wife and me, who found and maintain a loving relationship despite our differing phone preferences. My wife, an iPhone user, expresses a desire to switch to a Pixel, but is hindered by her iMessage group chats.\n\nPerhaps this \"green bubble\" bias reveals a deeper societal issue: a tendency to judge others based on superficial technological choices. In a world increasingly reliant on digital connections, it's worth considering the limitations we inadvertently impose through brand loyalty and platform preferences. Google's campaign, while lighthearted, serves as a timely reminder to embrace inclusivity, even in our texting habits. After all, meaningful connections transcend the color of a chat bubble. \n\nI hope that in the future, judging someone based on their phone choice will become as antiquated as using a rotary phone. I have to ask, are these ads working?\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/pxl-20250222-032415097.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A hand is holding a light-colored smartphone with a G logo on the back, featuring a horizontal camera bar.\"></p>\n<p>Having followed Google&rsquo;s Pixel line since its inception in 2016, from the original Pixel to the latest Pixel 9 Pro (and even the Pixel Fold), I&rsquo;ve developed a deep appreciation for Google&rsquo;s contributions to the smartphone market. My experience with iPhones (6, 6s, X, Xs, and 12) has further broadened my perspective. However, it&rsquo;s the budget Android segment, a significant portion of global smartphone sales, that truly captivates me. The Pixel 8a, initially released at $499 but now available for $300-$400 a year later, offers amazing value: a device promising six more years of feature updates.</p>\n<p>The Pixel 8a immediately feels comfortable in hand. It&rsquo;s easy to handle, not prone to slipping, and not overly heavy or clunky. While it lacks the premium feel of my Pixel 9 Pro, it possesses a reassuring solidity. It&rsquo;s like a familiar, comforting tool. The matte back feels surprisingly sturdy, almost like a warm porcelain countertop. The buttons offer a satisfying &ldquo;click,&rdquo; though they betray the phone&rsquo;s budget origins slightly, lacking the springy resistance of a higher-end device. Even after a year of use, the click persists. Crucially, one-handed use is a breeze, even for my (slightly above average) sized hands; reaching all four corners of the screen is effortless. It&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;mini&rdquo; phone, but it disappears comfortably into a back pocket, sometimes even flipping around due to its manageable size.</p>\n<p>The feel of a phone is paramount, as smartphones are deeply personal devices that perform a multitude of general and specialized tasks throughout our day. They need to feel approachable, relatable, and human – an extension of ourselves, not an interruption. The Pixel 8a achieves this beautifully, particularly with its matte finish and flat display. There&rsquo;s no awkwardness in holding it; the curvature simply settles into your hand.

Judge me by my size, do you?\"</em> - Yoda, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.</p>\n\n\n![Auto-generated description: A hand is holding a light-colored smartphone with a G logo on the back, featuring a horizontal camera bar.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/pxl-20250222-032415097.jpg)\n\n\nHaving followed Google's Pixel line since its inception in 2016, from the original Pixel to the latest Pixel 9 Pro (and even the Pixel Fold), I've developed a deep appreciation for Google's contributions to the smartphone market. My experience with iPhones (6, 6s, X, Xs, and 12) has further broadened my perspective. However, it's the budget Android segment, a significant portion of global smartphone sales, that truly captivates me. The Pixel 8a, initially released at $499 but now available for $300-$400 a year later, offers amazing value: a device promising six more years of feature updates.\n\n\nThe Pixel 8a immediately feels comfortable in hand. It's easy to handle, not prone to slipping, and not overly heavy or clunky. While it lacks the premium feel of my Pixel 9 Pro, it possesses a reassuring solidity. It's like a familiar, comforting tool. The matte back feels surprisingly sturdy, almost like a warm porcelain countertop. The buttons offer a satisfying \"click,\" though they betray the phone's budget origins slightly, lacking the springy resistance of a higher-end device. Even after a year of use, the click persists. Crucially, one-handed use is a breeze, even for my (slightly above average) sized hands; reaching all four corners of the screen is effortless. It's not a \"mini\" phone, but it disappears comfortably into a back pocket, sometimes even flipping around due to its manageable size.\n\n\nThe feel of a phone is paramount, as smartphones are deeply personal devices that perform a multitude of general and specialized tasks throughout our day. They need to feel approachable, relatable, and human – an extension of ourselves, not an interruption. The Pixel 8a achieves this beautifully, particularly with its matte finish and flat display. There's no awkwardness in holding it; the curvature simply settles into your hand. Unlike some flagship phones that scream \"luxury item,\" the 8a feels like a tool – one you appreciate more when you consciously focus on its thoughtful design.\n\n\nI particularly appreciate the rounded edges, reminiscent of a perfectly smooth doorknob. The camera bar, while subtle, is a minor point of contention. It creates a slight disruption, particularly when the phone is in a case (even official Google cases), unlike the more integrated camera module of the Pixel 9 Pro. But the color options – especially the Bay and Aloe (though my wife prefers the Porcelain of our review unit) – are absolutely delightful. My main design quibble is the bezels. While not overly large, they are noticeable. I prefer a more minimalist approach, though I understand the need for some bezel.\n\n\nThe Pixel \"a\" series, following the pattern of the 3a after the 3, the 4a after the 4, and so on, continues with the 8a. It borrows heavily from the Pixel 8, with some compromises in camera hardware, display, and (in previous years) wireless charging.

Using the Pro-mode controls, I adjusted shadows and brightness to highlight her features without compromising her natural complexion. The magic continued in post-processing with Google Photos. \n\n\nThe Magic Editor effortlessly removed distracting elements like trash cans and light posts, while a touch of vignette added a final touch of mystique, drawing attention to her captivating expressions..\n\n\n<div class=\"microblog_collection\"><img src=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/uploads/2025/9cb9916eb0-m.jpg\" alt=\"A person leans against a stone wall outdoors, smiling and wearing a denim jacket and long skirt.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/9cb9916eb0.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/uploads/2025/0d3c4414d4-m.jpg\" alt=\"A woman in a light denim jacket and silver dress is standing on a pathway, with a soft smile and hands clasped in front of her.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/0d3c4414d4.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/uploads/2025/1993c08718-m.jpg\" alt=\"A woman wearing a denim jacket and sunglasses is standing outdoors, basking in sunlight, with bare trees in the background.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/1993c08718.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/uploads/2025/c9802bc4a1-m.jpg\" alt=\"A person wearing a denim jacket holds flowers and stands beside a window with a display of flowers.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/c9802bc4a1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/uploads/2025/4284e92586-m.jpg\" alt=\"A person wearing a light-colored skirt and denim jacket leans against a stone wall on a brick path next to trees and a railing.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/4284e92586.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/uploads/2025/pxl-20240219-2212064044-m.jpg\" alt=\"A woman in a denim jacket and long skirt poses playfully on a walkway with a stone building in the background.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/pxl-20240219-2212064044.jpg\"></div>\n\n\nThis photoshoot was more than just a technical exercise; it was a chance to connect with my cousin and celebrate her transition into womanhood.

Mostly Android 9+ devices. And there&rsquo;s been a lot of misinformation about it so I figured I&rsquo;d provide more <strong>correct</strong> information on the web about it. In short, it&rsquo;s like having a bouncer for your phone. <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/5-new-protections-on-google-messages.html\">You can read the entire blog post from Google about it on their Security Blog</a>, but I&rsquo;ll try to explain in less detail. In short, Google lists the following new protections:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Enhances detection protects you from package delivery and job scams.</li>\n<li>Intelligent warnings alert you about potentially dangerous links.</li>\n<li>Controls to turn off messages from unknown international senders.</li>\n<li>Sensitive Content Warnings give you control over seeing and sending images that may contain nudity.</li>\n<li>More confirmation about who you&rsquo;re messaging.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So this bouncer uses AI to spot shady stuff like spam, scams, malware, and even those NSFW pics (yikes!) in your messages and apps. The best part? It does all this without snitching to Google or anyone else. Think of it like a super-smart security guard who can spot trouble without calling the cops. By not snitching to Google or anyone else or calling the cops, it&rsquo;s not sending your information to anyone. <strong>ANYONE</strong>.</p>\n<p>Now, some people have been mistakenly thinking, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this like that client-side scanning thing Apple tried to pull?&rdquo; Nah, not even close. That was all about scanning your pics and <strong>reporting</strong> potentially illegal stuff, which was a major privacy no-no.</p>\n<p>Android&rsquo;s SafetyCore is different. It keeps everything on your phone and doesn&rsquo;t share anything with anyone. It&rsquo;s more like Apple&rsquo;s Communication Safety feature in iMessage, which warns kids about sensitive content but doesn&rsquo;t share anything with Apple.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, like I said, <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/mx.twitch/post/DGLwlHjT8oP?xmt=AQGzUsce7b-QIBKJFL80bCxQmwUvY_uU2zn6GZF2iI_mqw\">there&rsquo;s been some misinformation</a> floating around about SafetyCore, with some folks calling it &ldquo;spyware.&rdquo;  But that&rsquo;s simply not true. As the privacy-focused folks at <a href=\"https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1888280836426084502?mx=2\">GrapheneOS put it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The app doesn&rsquo;t provide client-side scanning used to report things to Google or anyone else. It provides on-device machine learning models usable by applications to classify content as being spam, scams, malware, etc. This allows apps to check content locally without sharing it with a service and mark it with warnings for users.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The GrapheneOS team are experts in this field, and they clearly state that <strong>SafetyCore doesn&rsquo;t share your data</strong>.  So, you can rest assured that your privacy is protected.</p>\n<p>The GrapheneOS team does wish Google would make the whole thing open source, which would increase transparency and trust. I agree  with this too, but here&rsquo;s the thing: apps have been able to do this AI security stuff for a while now, but they usually send your data to their servers. <strong>SafetyCore keeps everything local, which is a big win for privacy.</strong></p>\n<p>Okay, so circling back to that <em>&ldquo;not snitching to the cops&rdquo;</em> part: SafetyCore isn&rsquo;t about reporting illegal stuff to the authorities. It&rsquo;s simply about giving your phone the ability to spot potentially harmful stuff and give you a heads up. Remember that and take that how you will.</p>\n<p>So, there you have it! The TL;DR is <strong>Google&rsquo;s Android System SafetyCore seems like a pretty sweet deal for boosting your phone&rsquo;s security and privacy</strong>.

				"title": "AI's Promise: Insights from the AI Summit in Paris",
				"content_html": "<p>We&rsquo;re at a fascinating moment with Artificial Intelligence. It feels like everyone&rsquo;s talking about it, some with excitement, others with a bit of trepidation.  It reminds me of something Pharrell Williams said at the recent AI Summit in Paris:</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-internet-in-the-90speople-were-genuinely-worried\">&ldquo;The internet in the &rsquo;90s&hellip;people were genuinely worried.&rdquo;</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/359a186e66.jpg\" alt=\"Three people are seated on stage, engaged in a panel discussion, with one person speaking into a microphone.\"></p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s right. By doing a little research and seeing how people viewed the internet back then, I&rsquo;ve gotten a good understanding of just how worried many were. Some marveled at the instant access to information, while others worried about its impact. It&rsquo;s funny, isn&rsquo;t it? Fast forward to today, and it&rsquo;s hard to imagine life without it. We&rsquo;re at a similar inflection point with AI, and honestly, I think that&rsquo;s what makes events like the AI Summit in Paris so important. They bring together people from all over the world—researchers, tech companies, everyday consumers—and spark a global conversation about what AI can achieve.  This isn&rsquo;t about robots taking over; it&rsquo;s about AI becoming a powerful partner, accelerating human ingenuity and ushering in a new era of innovation. And this vision was echoed by Sundar Pichai, who emphasized the incredible potential of AI to address some of humanity&rsquo;s greatest challenges.</p>\n<p>I think one of the biggest hurdles AI faces is perception. We&rsquo;ve all seen the movies—the iRobot antagonist, the Matrix scenarios—and it&rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of thinking AI is inherently malicious, destined to take our jobs and turn us into batteries. But like most things in life, there&rsquo;s a good side to this. Just like any tool, AI can be used for good or bad. And at the AI Summit, we saw so many examples of the <strong>good</strong> it can do.</p>\n<p>AI isn&rsquo;t a sudden invention; it&rsquo;s the next logical step in our technological evolution. Just as we moved from basic computing to the internet, and then to mobile, AI is now poised to become ubiquitous. Imagine a &ldquo;universal AI assistant&rdquo; – seamlessly integrated into your Android phone, your Google Workspace, your smart home, and beyond.

And science is where we&rsquo;re seeing some truly mind-blowing breakthroughs. Consider AlphaFold, a super-smart AI from DeepMind, that can predict how proteins are shaped with incredible accuracy. Proteins are like the building blocks of life, and knowing their shape is key to understanding diseases and developing new treatments. Researchers estimate that AlphaFold has saved years of research time, not just days or weeks. Over a million researchers worldwide have used AlphaFold, accessing over 200 million protein structure predictions, accelerating research in areas from drug discovery to combating antibiotic resistance. Building on this success, Isomorphic Labs is using machine learning to revolutionize drug design, potentially shortening development timelines and creating more effective treatments. And we&rsquo;re just scratching the surface. The next big thing on the horizon? It&rsquo;s called Quantum Computing. Imagine regular computers as light bulbs—they can be on or off. Quantum computers are more like lasers—they can be on, off, <strong>and</strong> a whole bunch of other states in between. This gives them the potential to solve problems that are impossible for today&rsquo;s computers. Breakthroughs like Google&rsquo;s Willow quantum chip, with its improved coherence and control, promise to unlock computational power previously unimaginable.

				"content_text": "We're at a fascinating moment with Artificial Intelligence. It feels like everyone's talking about it, some with excitement, others with a bit of trepidation.  It reminds me of something Pharrell Williams said at the recent AI Summit in Paris:\n\n## \"The internet in the '90s...people were genuinely worried.\"\n\n![Three people are seated on stage, engaged in a panel discussion, with one person speaking into a microphone.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/359a186e66.jpg)\n\nHe's right. By doing a little research and seeing how people viewed the internet back then, I've gotten a good understanding of just how worried many were. Some marveled at the instant access to information, while others worried about its impact. It's funny, isn't it? Fast forward to today, and it's hard to imagine life without it. We're at a similar inflection point with AI, and honestly, I think that's what makes events like the AI Summit in Paris so important. They bring together people from all over the world—researchers, tech companies, everyday consumers—and spark a global conversation about what AI can achieve.  This isn't about robots taking over; it's about AI becoming a powerful partner, accelerating human ingenuity and ushering in a new era of innovation. And this vision was echoed by Sundar Pichai, who emphasized the incredible potential of AI to address some of humanity's greatest challenges.\n\nI think one of the biggest hurdles AI faces is perception. We've all seen the movies—the iRobot antagonist, the Matrix scenarios—and it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking AI is inherently malicious, destined to take our jobs and turn us into batteries. But like most things in life, there's a good side to this. Just like any tool, AI can be used for good or bad. And at the AI Summit, we saw so many examples of the **good** it can do.\n\nAI isn't a sudden invention; it's the next logical step in our technological evolution. Just as we moved from basic computing to the internet, and then to mobile, AI is now poised to become ubiquitous. Imagine a \"universal AI assistant\" – seamlessly integrated into your Android phone, your Google Workspace, your smart home, and beyond. This is the vision behind concepts like \"Project Astra\": AI that understands context, anticipates needs, and assists you across all aspects of your life. It's not just a feature; it's a fundamental shift in how we interact with technology.\n\nAI's real magic? It's all about collaboration. And science is where we're seeing some truly mind-blowing breakthroughs. Consider AlphaFold, a super-smart AI from DeepMind, that can predict how proteins are shaped with incredible accuracy. Proteins are like the building blocks of life, and knowing their shape is key to understanding diseases and developing new treatments.

This changes everything, from ads and content to how we even define &ldquo;television.&rdquo; And speaking of the living room, let’s not forget YouTube Primetime!

YouTube&rsquo;s dominance in podcasts, for example, is surprising but also makes sense.  More podcast integration could be a game-changer for creators and listeners.

				"content_html": "<p>I was recently reminded of the perception that people with Android phones are seen as stubborn and non-conforming when someone asked me why I don&rsquo;t have an iPhone. This happened during an in-person conversation when I used my Pixel to reply to a text. The person simply asked why I didn&rsquo;t have an iPhone, and I replied that I prefer the phone I have. It seemed so unfamiliar to them. This experience echoed as I watched the Lakers game, noticing the sea of iPhones in the stands.

I love being able to personalize my home screen with widgets and icon packs that reflect my style. It&rsquo;s not about being different; it&rsquo;s about having a phone that truly feels like mine. And the variety! There are so many different Android phones available, each with its own strengths. I chose my Pixel because of its camera and its smooth performance, but someone else might prefer a phone with a longer battery life or a larger screen. The point is, there&rsquo;s an Android phone out there for everyone.</p>\n<p>But in the past five years, my preference for Pixel has solidified even further because of its seamless integration with cutting-edge AI.

It seemed like Apple was, and frankly still is, quite behind the competition in the AI space.

This year, my excitement peaked with the halftime performance, followed by the game, and then the ads.

Congratulations, Eagles!</p>\n<p>I was particularly interested in seeing how others received Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dream Job&rdquo; commercial, which I absolutely loved. I&rsquo;d rate it a &ldquo;B+,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ll explain why after sharing what others had to say.

Here&rsquo;s what they had to say about it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Google using straight-up emotional terrorism to sell phones now, showing a young girl embracing her father as both a child and as a college student. Wicked, but effective.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I get it, but the point is to be effective and it really is. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/09/nx-s1-5273643/super-bowl-commercials-best-worst\">NPR didn&rsquo;t dish out a grade, but they did a much better job explaining the complexity Google accomplished with this ad</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Typically, an AI, which sounds like a real person coaching you through a hypothetical job interview, might give off serious vibes like HAL 9000 (the killer computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey). But Google&rsquo;s ad features a father talking about his work experience to the Gemini Live AI chatbot — &ldquo;I show up every day, no matter what&rdquo; — while imagery reveals he&rsquo;s talking about raising his daughter. It adds up to an emotive, touching spot that emphasizes how people can use technology to perform better, rather than depicting a giant corporation offering software that encourages you to depend on them more as every year passes — seeing AI less as a job killer and more like a job search enabler.

See his post below.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The commercial was generally well-received, and I was impressed.  It successfully captured a human and relatable tone, demonstrating Gemini&rsquo;s practical applications on the Pixel.  The subtle approach to Pixel promotion aligns with Android&rsquo;s focus on user choice (within its own ecosystem).  While the ad masterfully evoked human emotion, the sales message felt slightly less developed, which kept it from an &lsquo;A&rsquo; grade.  Strategically, Google may have prioritized associating human emotion with the brand over direct sales.  Perhaps a relatable celebrity could have further amplified this emotional connection.  Regardless, I found it highly enjoyable.</p>\n<p>Now go rewatch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDorKy-13ak\">Kendrick Lamar&rsquo;s halftime performance</a>.</p>\n",

It successfully captured a human and relatable tone, demonstrating Gemini's practical applications on the Pixel.  The subtle approach to Pixel promotion aligns with Android's focus on user choice (within its own ecosystem).  While the ad masterfully evoked human emotion, the sales message felt slightly less developed, which kept it from an 'A' grade.  Strategically, Google may have prioritized associating human emotion with the brand over direct sales.  Perhaps a relatable celebrity could have further amplified this emotional connection.  Regardless, I found it highly enjoyable. \r\n\r\nNow go rewatch [Kendrick Lamar's halftime performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDorKy-13ak). \r\n",

Finding these relics reminds us of how far Android has come, and how deeply rooted its passionate fan base is. \n\nTo all ex-Google, veteran Google employees or long-standing Android fans, if you have any vintage Android treasures hiding in your cupboards, please share more of them!\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/72af1a2095.jpg\" width=\"337\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/b2a2121948.jpg\" width=\"430\" height=\"430\" alt=\"\">\n",

When you wake up every day and realize that you are an individual, you have to carry that authentic nature and allow yourself to say, &ldquo;This is who I am. This is how people are going to see me and respect me.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s going to inspire people to have truth. When everyone is authentic, what comes out of that is true love.

Products can be announced with shiny, inspiring keynotes promising to \"make the world a better place,\" but they also have a darker side. **This is Google's dark side today, and I strongly disapprove of it.** This decision could lead to the development of AI-powered weapons systems, increased surveillance, and other ethically problematic applications.\n\n[Google’s “AI Principles” in 2018](https://blog.google/technology/ai/ai-principles/)\n\n[Google’s “AI Principles” in 2025](https://blog.google/technology/ai/responsible-ai-2024-report-ongoing-work/)\n\n**Proverbs 16:25**: _\"There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death.\"_\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/gemini-generated-image-g3wbz9g3wbz9g3wb.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n",

This is bidirectional with the ability to transfer a song from the Pixel Tablet to your Pixel phone also available.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Officially, Google is using a “range of technologies to determine the proximity and presence of devices as part of multi-device experiences, which includes UWB.” Its Cross device SDK was announced in 2022 and consists of three layers:</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><em>“The first layer recognizes what devices are physically close by, with wireless technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi, and ultra-wideband (UWB).”</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><em>“The second layer is nearby device discovery and context-aware capabilities that identify which device you may want to use based on your current activity.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><em>“Finally, the third layer understands and adjusts actions based on how you interact with your devices with cross-device intelligence.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Google went as far to explain that &ldquo;Tap to Cast&rdquo; is available without any additional work if developers integrate <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/android_sender/output_switcher\">Output Switcher (2.0) on Android 14</a>. Right now, it&rsquo;s only available with YouTube Music and Spotify with UWB enabled Pixel devices like my Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel Tablet.

I heard about the feature when it was announced, but I never knew when it would reach my devices. It was a nice surprise. Especially when it was a happenstance instead of, like I used to, spam the update button to get the latest features. I need to take on that practice more. See the feature announced and go about my day, not angrily spam the \"update\" button and shake my fist at the clouds like a mad man, trying to force the feature to my devices. \r\n\r\nI digress. Abner at [9to5Google explained it best](https://9to5google.com/2024/01/09/pixel-tablet-tap-to-cast/) back in January, 2024: \r\n\r\n>_When listening with YouTube Music or Spotify, bringing your Pixel 6 Pro, 7 Pro, 8 Pro, or Fold – which all have UWB (Ultra-Wideband) – near a docked Pixel Tablet will seamlessly move what’s playing between devices. This is bidirectional with the ability to transfer a song from the Pixel Tablet to your Pixel phone also available._\r\n\r\n> _Officially, Google is using a “range of technologies to determine the proximity and presence of devices as part of multi-device experiences, which includes UWB.” Its Cross device SDK was announced in 2022 and consists of three layers:_\r\n\r\n> * _“The first layer recognizes what devices are physically close by, with wireless technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi, and ultra-wideband (UWB).”_\r\n\r\n> * _“The second layer is nearby device discovery and context-aware capabilities that identify which device you may want to use based on your current activity.”_\r\n\r\n> * _“Finally, the third layer understands and adjusts actions based on how you interact with your devices with cross-device intelligence.”_\r\n\r\nGoogle went as far to explain that \"Tap to Cast\" is available without any additional work if developers integrate [Output Switcher (2.0) on Android 14](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/android_sender/output_switcher). Right now, it's only available with YouTube Music and Spotify with UWB enabled Pixel devices like my Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel Tablet. It's nice to know that this isn't an exclusive Pixel feature so more hardware and apps could be supported in the future! \r\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/pxl-20250130-230659756-exported-5900-1.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n",

				"title": "Android XR: The Dawn of a New Era in Headset Innovation?",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>After watching Marques Brownlee's exclusive look at the Samsung prototype running Android XR, I'm buzzing with a level of excitement I haven't felt for a new tech platform in years. While Apple's visionOS and Meta's HorizonOS are intriguing, Android XR feels different. It carries the same vibrant energy as the early days of Android, promising a wave of innovation and diverse hardware experiences that could truly revolutionize the XR space.</p><p>Think back to the launch of Android. Every time Google's mobile OS enters a new form factor – smartphones, tablets, smartwatches – it ignites a spark. Suddenly, a flurry of manufacturers, both established giants and nimble startups, emerge with unique hardware interpretations. We see a burst of creativity, pushing the boundaries of design and functionality. This is precisely what Android XR promises for headsets.</p><p>The open nature of Android fosters a healthy ecosystem. It's not just one company dictating the entire experience, limiting choices and stifling innovation. Instead, Android XR empowers hardware makers to focus on what they do best: crafting amazing devices. Companies like Sony, XReal, and countless others we haven't even heard of yet will have access to a robust software foundation, allowing them to differentiate themselves through innovative hardware designs and specialized features. This echoes the dynamism we've seen in the Android smartphone market, and it's precisely what the XR space needs.</p><p>But the excitement doesn't stop at the open ecosystem. What truly blew me away was the sheer polish and sophistication of the Android XR software, even in its prototype stage. Remember those early \"Nexus\" devices, the developer previews that often left a lot to be desired? Think back to the barebones experience of the first Nexus phones or the initial Android Wear watches like the LG G Watch. Android XR is a completely different beast. It's clear that Google and Samsung have poured significant effort into crafting a premium software experience from the get-go.</p><p>The integration of AI, exemplified by the Gemini assistant, is truly mind-blowing. Seeing how effortlessly Gemini can be used for navigation, app interaction, and even real-time environmental information feels like stepping into the realm of science fiction – in the best possible way. The \"circle to search\" feature, similar to Google Lens, adds another layer of intuitive interaction. It feels like we're witnessing the birth of a truly intelligent and immersive computing platform.</p><p>This whole experience resonates deeply with me. As I've been reading Chet Haase's \"Androids: The Team that Built the Android Operating System,\" the collaboration between Samsung and Google on Android XR feels like a modern-day parallel to the \"mixing bowl\" of engineering talent that birthed the original Android. Just like the engineers from Danger, Be/PalmSource, and WebTV/Microsoft came together to create something magical, the partnership between Samsung and Google has the potential to shape the future of XR.</p><p>I'm keeping my expectations in check for now, but the potential of Android XR is undeniable. More than just one company selling its ecosystem and controlling every aspect of the experience, Android XR represents a fundamental shift. It's a platform that fosters open innovation, empowers hardware makers, and promises a diverse range of devices and experiences. It's the dawn of a new era in headset technology, and I, for one, am incredibly excited to see what the future holds.</p>\n",

				"title": "I Almost Switched to iPhone, But Then Gemini Happened…",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Google just announced quite a few updates to Gemini and is partnering with Samsung to bring these features at scale with the Galaxy S25. And, to no surprise, it's <a href=\"https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/articles/gemini-live-updates/\">rolling out to Pixel 9 series</a> and soon to older Pixel devices such as the Pixel 6.</p><p>One thing I want to point out, though, is how, just 7 months ago, I was considering switching to an iPhone because of Apple Intelligence. You see, when Apple performed their tech infomercial at WWDC, showcasing Apple Intelligence, I was smitten. On cloud nine, envisioning two things: 1. There's no way Android would be able to replicate Apple's AI cohesiveness across the entire mobile OS and 2. Me walking into my carrier's retail store to purchase the latest iPhone 16 that would come with all of the Apple Intelligence features that was announced at WWDC. Wild what can change in 7 months. </p><p>During that 7 months, news got out that not only is the iPhone 16 not getting all of those Apple Intelligence features on day one, but it'll be a whole six to twelve months before all of those features will be available. Maybe I missed that part of the WWDC infomercial, but <a href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/why-i-find-apple-intelligence-underwhelming/#:~:text=All%20the%20Features%20Aren%E2%80%99t%20Even%20Out%20Yet\">I'm not alone in that brief misunderstanding</a>.</p><p>But then, the tides turned. Google swooped in with Gemini, and suddenly the AI landscape shifted dramatically. Fast-forwarding to today, just about everything that I was excited about in Apple Intelligence that still isn't out, not even on the latest iPhone, is currently available on Android with Gemini, specifically Pixel 9 Pro. One of the highlighting features is multi-extensions — the ability to prompt Gemini to do multiple things simultaneously. </p><p>For example, and this just happened a few hours ago, I received an updated note about a wedding my wife, Fatima, and I are going to this Saturday, confirming the location of where the reception is going to be held and what time. It was a pretty lengthy note that would've taken me multiple swipes back and forth between the Messages app, the wedding note, copying back and forth and vice versa to relay the message to my wife. Instead, all I did was prompt Gemini with the wedding note in its entirety and vocally told Gemini, \"Summarize this wedding note, send it to my wife, letting her know that I received this from our friends, and add the reception on my calendar.\" And, in one swoop, it did all three of those things. Summarized the wedding note, created a text to Fatima that prompted me to confirm with a simple, \"Yes\", and added the reception event with the location and correct time on my Google Calendar. Truly a marvelous experience.</p><p>To really grasp how seamlessly this all works, take a look at this…</p><div class=\"native-video-embed\" data-component-name=\"VideoPlaceholder\" data-attrs=\"{\"mediaUploadId\":\"416218c7-4d72-488c-ab49-1ac2b7eb9b5d\",\"duration\":null}\"></div><p></p><p>There are quite a few other features that Google announced during Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event, but this one truly confirmed to me that I made the right decision sticking with my Google Pixel and not getting an iPhone this year. Maybe Apple can magically pull a MacBook Air out of a dossier (hope you get that reference) and change my mind. Probably not.</p>\n",

At least, that's what my mom exclaimed when she called me the other day. Yes, <em>called</em> me. On the actual phone. Seems the latest Facebook shenanigans have finally pushed her to the edge. \"Is there an alternative?\" she asked, her voice laced with a mix of frustration and hope. And, for a moment, I was stumped. The truth is, there isn't an easy answer, especially for someone not steeped in the world of tech. My mind immediately went to the Fediverse, but explaining that to my mom—who'd never even heard the term before—felt like opening a Pandora's Box of technical jargon. This got me thinking. </p><p>Here I am, a tech enthusiast, once a proud Google+ user, now longing for the simpler days of the early Web 2.0 blogosphere. It's almost like admitting defeat, isn't it? But after being burned twice—<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18290637/google-plus-shutdown-consumer-personal-account-delete\">first by Google+</a>, then by Twitter's dramatic transformation into X—I've come to realize the vital importance of owning my own digital space.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{\"url\":\"[michaelbtech.substack.com/subscribe](https://michaelbtech.substack.com/subscribe?)\",\"text\":\"Subscribe\",\"language\":\"en\"}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Thanks for reading MichaelBTech!

It's a fascinating concept, this Fediverse, but it's not without its challenges. It's still a bit like the Wild West out there, with different communities and protocols, and it can be quite daunting for those who aren't particularly tech-savvy. And that's precisely where the \"burn me once, shame on you...\" feeling comes in. After pouring time and energy into building a presence on Google+, only to see it wither and die, and then experiencing the upheaval of Twitter's metamorphosis into X, I've become hesitant to invest heavily in any single platform. It's like building a house on rented land – you never know when the landlord might decide to change the terms of the lease or even evict you altogether.</p><p>That's why owning a domain, having your own little corner of the web, is more crucial now than ever. It's like owning the land your house is built on. You have control, you have stability, and you're not subject to the whims of some corporate overlord. This whole \"convenience-over-ownership\" trend extends beyond the digital realm, doesn't it? Leasing instead of buying, streaming instead of owning your media… we seem to be losing choice in favor of ease of use. It reminds me of that quote, often (though perhaps erroneously) attributed to Mahatma Gandhi: <em>\"Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.\"</em> Are we trading the freedom to tinker and customize for the perceived safety of the walled garden?</p><p>This even impacts how we view our devices. With Android, I feel like I <em>own</em> it, unlike iOS, where Apple controls everything. This is slowly changing through regulation (link an article here), but it makes you wonder about the long-term effects. A <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90839901/dell-study-gen-z-success-in-digital-world\">Dell study</a> found 37% of Gen Z feel unprepared for the demands of the digital world, and 56% lack digital skills education. Are we raising a generation that can only operate within restrictive ecosystems? A friend recently pointed out how we've drifted from the \"old internet,\" where human-created content and community-run services were the norm. He argues that we've prioritized convenience over ethics, safety, and community. This really hit home. </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/https3a2f2fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2fpublic2fimages2fa13518b8-1.png\" width=\"924\" height=\"837\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"[substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/im...](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png)\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":837,\"width\":924,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":332748,\"alt\":null,\"title\":null,\"type\":\"image/png\",\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":false,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png 1272w, https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/https3a2f2fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2fpublic2fimages2fa13518b8-1.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>My wife and I were discussing how, if you post an Instagram photo directing people to a blog post or article on your own site, they're less likely to click. It's just more convenient to stay within Instagram's walled garden, even if it means missing out on potentially valuable content or different perspectives.</p><p>The Fediverse, with its decentralized nature and emphasis on community, offers a potential solution. By moving to these platforms, we can regain some of the control we've lost and prioritize factors like ethics, safety, and community. Of course, the Fediverse and other decentralized platforms offer a glimmer of hope. They represent a potential future where we're not at the mercy of tech giants. But for now, they remain a bit too complex and fragmented for mass adoption. So, where does this leave us in our quest for a Facebook alternative? Well, the truth is, there's no easy answer. The Fediverse, while promising, is still a bit like the Wild West, and it may not be everyone's cup of tea. But this whole exploration has underscored a crucial point: we can't just passively accept the status quo. We need to be mindful of where we build our digital homes and who controls the land they sit on.</p><p>Whether you decide to dip your toes into the Fediverse, explore other emerging platforms, or simply double down on owning your own domain, the key is to stay informed and take control of your online destiny. Don't let \"Mark Zingaburg\" (or anyone else, for that matter) dictate your digital life. Explore your options, find what works best for you, and remember – the internet is vast and ever-evolving. There's a whole world out there beyond the walled gardens of Facebook and the like.

				"content_text": "<p>The Pixel Fold, Google's ambitious entry into the foldable phone arena, is finally here, and has received <a href=\"https://youtu.be/E76CUtSHMrU?si=uLxJAfpkvghe11Yd\">glowing reviews into its second iteration</a>. But while the hardware is impressive, the foldable market itself remains a niche. Year-over-year growth is sluggish, and consumers seem hesitant to embrace this new form factor. That's why I say this: <strong>Google should pump the brakes on a Pixel 10 Pro Fold in 2025</strong>.</p><p>Yes, you heard me right. Instead of rushing out a new model next year, Google should focus on refining the software experience for the existing Pixel Fold. With a promised 7 years of updates, there's ample opportunity to polish the Fold's software, optimize apps for the unique form factor, and truly deliver on the promise of foldable productivity and entertainment.</p><p>This isn't about abandoning the Fold. It's about strategic timing. As <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-roadmap-2023-3259454/\">Android Authority reported last year</a>:</p><p><em>\"Pushing into 2025, our source says Google is looking at several choices for its Pixel roadmap. The success or failure of its 2023 and 2024 plans will influence this decision... Finally, the fate of any Pixel Fold successors in 2025 is still dependent on its market reception.\"</em></p><p>Google has options. A \"wait-and-see\" approach allows them to assess the market, perfect the Fold's software, and deliver a truly compelling successor when the time is right. Perhaps a Pixel 11 Pro Fold in 2026, packed with meaningful advancements and responding to clear consumer demand, would be a more prudent move.</p><p>Now, I know what you're thinking: Won't this signal a lack of commitment to the foldable market? Not if Google plays its cards right. They need to be transparent, explaining their strategy and emphasizing their long-term vision for the Pixel Fold. This isn't a retreat; it's a calculated pause to ensure the next Fold is a home run.</p><p>In the fast-paced world of tech, sometimes slowing down is the smartest way to get ahead. This isn't Google's first foldable, and learning from past experiences is crucial. By giving the Pixel Fold room to breathe, Google can address existing shortcomings, observe the evolving market, and build anticipation for a truly refined successor. Think of it as a chef perfecting a complex recipe; the first attempt might be good, but with careful refinement, the final dish can be truly exceptional.</p>\n",

While I respect Wired&rsquo;s perspective, I disagree with their assessment. I believe the Apple Vision Pro is not a flop, but rather a bold step into the future of mixed reality.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Senior Commerce Editor Julian Chokkattu <!-- raw HTML omitted -->highlights some valid points in his section on the Vision Pro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;I am writing this story on the Apple Vision Pro. I like using it for work more so than entertainment, though I did watch The Weeknd&rsquo;s Open Hearts, an interactive music experience where I was face-to-face with the musician as he was being hauled away in an ambulance through various Inception-esque environments. The visual quality of the film is impressive and it feels immersive to watch—you can see beads of sweat on his face—but there are also moments when the camera changes to sweeping views that look too grainy and pixelated. Apple has released several immersive experiences like this throughout 2024, including a film called Submerged.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Technically, I&rsquo;m using the Vision Pro in Mac Virtual Display mode. I have it wirelessly connected to Apple&rsquo;s new Mac Mini, which brings your computer&rsquo;s screen into a spatial environment, allowing you to place other visionOS apps around it. This mode now gives you options for your Mac&rsquo;s screen size: Standard, Wide, and Ultrawide. I&rsquo;m using the latter and have two browser windows open side by side, plus Slack off to the left, and I&rsquo;m using Apple&rsquo;s Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad. It&rsquo;s great.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s hard not to leave the Vision Pro experience without feeling impressed each time, though I wish this darn battery cable was a little longer. (It slid off my desk while I was wearing the headset, but I thankfully caught the pack before it pulled the wire.) But with Google and Samsung&rsquo;s recent announcement of Android XR, we can expect similar mixed-reality headsets on the way in 2025, and I have a hard time believing most of them will cost as much as the Vision Pro. That&rsquo;s ultimately the main problem with Apple&rsquo;s big 2024 release: It&rsquo;s too far out of reach for almost everyone.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Think back to the original iPhone. It was expensive, had limited functionality compared to today&rsquo;s standards, and yet, it revolutionized the mobile phone industry.

While I respect Wired's perspective, I disagree with their assessment. I believe the Apple Vision Pro is not a flop, but rather a bold step into the future of mixed reality.</p><p>Senior Commerce Editor Julian Chokkattu <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/revisiting-the-three-biggest-flops-of-2024/\">highlights some valid points in his section on the Vision Pro</a>:&nbsp;</p><p><em>\"I am writing this story on the Apple Vision Pro. I like using it for work more so than entertainment, though I did watch The Weeknd's Open Hearts, an interactive music experience where I was face-to-face with the musician as he was being hauled away in an ambulance through various Inception-esque environments. The visual quality of the film is impressive and it feels immersive to watch—you can see beads of sweat on his face—but there are also moments when the camera changes to sweeping views that look too grainy and pixelated. Apple has released several immersive experiences like this throughout 2024, including a film called Submerged.</em></p><p><em>Technically, I'm using the Vision Pro in Mac Virtual Display mode. I have it wirelessly connected to Apple's new Mac Mini, which brings your computer's screen into a spatial environment, allowing you to place other visionOS apps around it. This mode now gives you options for your Mac's screen size: Standard, Wide, and Ultrawide. I'm using the latter and have two browser windows open side by side, plus Slack off to the left, and I'm using Apple's Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad. It's great.</em></p><p><em>It's hard not to leave the Vision Pro experience without feeling impressed each time, though I wish this darn battery cable was a little longer. (It slid off my desk while I was wearing the headset, but I thankfully caught the pack before it pulled the wire.) But with Google and Samsung's recent announcement of Android XR, we can expect similar mixed-reality headsets on the way in 2025, and I have a hard time believing most of them will cost as much as the Vision Pro. That's ultimately the main problem with Apple's big 2024 release: It's too far out of reach for almost everyone.\"</em></p><p>Think back to the original iPhone. It was expensive, had limited functionality compared to today's standards, and yet, it revolutionized the mobile phone industry. The Apple Vision Pro could very well do the same for mixed reality.</p><p>In 10 years, I predict the Apple Vision Pro will still be a niche product, but it will have paved the way for more affordable and accessible Apple headsets. Google and Samsung's <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/android-xr/\">Android XR headsets</a> will likely be strong competitors, offering aggressive pricing and impressive hardware.

				"title": "Pixelbook Go Review: 5 Years Later",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>In the fall of 2019, Google unveiled the Pixelbook Go, a Chromebook aimed at those who wanted a premium, lightweight device without the premium price tag of its predecessor, the Pixelbook. I, however, didn't join the Go bandwagon until two years later, snagging a \"like new\" i5 model with 16GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD for a cool $700 on Swappa. A steal, considering its original $999 MSRP.</p><p>Why a Chromebook in 2021, you ask? Well, dear reader, while my employer generously provides a work laptop, I yearned for a personal machine for those coffee shop jaunts and casual browsing sessions. Something fast, secure, and delightfully simple. Having spent my early career hawking Chromebooks in the aisles of Best Buy, I knew this was the answer.</p><blockquote><p>Speaking of software, one of the biggest draws for me was the maturing of Linux on ChromeOS.</p></blockquote><p>And the Pixelbook Go hasn't disappointed. This isn't your average Chromebook, mind you. The keyboard is a dream – responsive and whisper-quiet, perfect for hammering out emails or tackling a blog post (like this one!). The 1080p webcam is a welcome upgrade from the grainy cameras of yore, making me look presentable in Google Meet calls. Plus, with Google's commitment to ten years of software updates (a recent extension from the initial seven), this machine is built for the long haul.</p>\n<p>But it hasn't been all sunshine and roses. As I began to delve deeper into the world of ChromeOS and its surprisingly robust \"organized workspace\" features, the 13.3-inch screen started to feel a tad cramped. Juggling multiple terminal windows, server configurations, and IDEs for my coding projects became a spatial challenge.</p><p>Speaking of software, one of the biggest draws for me was the maturing of Linux on ChromeOS. No longer a clunky afterthought, it's now a fully integrated environment, allowing me to run my favorite Linux applications alongside my ChromeOS workflow. This, combined with the impressive performance of the i5 processor, makes the Pixelbook Go a surprisingly capable machine for developers and tinkerers. </p><p>My wife, charmed by the Go's portability and sleek design, even decided to join the club. We snagged her the \"Not Pink\" i5 model with 8GB of RAM – more than enough for her needs. </p>\n<p>Looking ahead, I'm curious to see how Google's Chromebook strategy evolves. Rumors are swirling about <a href=\"https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-laptop-development.html\">Android laptops becoming the future</a>. If these rumors bear fruit, I might be tempted to upgrade sooner than my planned 2027 refresh. But for now, the Pixelbook Go remains my trusty companion, a testament to Google's vision of a simple, secure, and (mostly) satisfying computing experience.</p>\n",

While the prospect of an Apple-branded search experience might pique the curiosity of tech enthusiasts, a closer look reveals this is a shrewd decision that aligns perfectly with Apple&rsquo;s core business strategy.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eddy Cue, Apple&rsquo;s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, recently filed a declaration, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reported by Reuters<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, with a U.S. federal court outlining the company&rsquo;s rationale. Cue&rsquo;s arguments are compelling, painting a picture of a project fraught with challenges and misaligned with Apple&rsquo;s strengths, stating the following:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The development of a search engine would cost Apple &ldquo;billions of dollars&rdquo; and &ldquo;take many years,&rdquo; and this would divert investment money and employees away from &ldquo;other growth areas&rdquo; that the company is focused on.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The search business is &ldquo;rapidly evolving&rdquo; due to artificial intelligence, so it would be &ldquo;economically risky&rdquo; for Apple to create a search engine.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In order to create a &ldquo;viable&rdquo; search engine business, Apple would be required to &ldquo;sell targeted advertising,&rdquo; which is &ldquo;not a core business&rdquo; for the company and would go against its &ldquo;longstanding privacy commitments.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple does not have enough &ldquo;specialized professionals&rdquo; and &ldquo;operational infrastructure&rdquo; needed to build and run a successful search engine business.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But here&rsquo;s the kicker: Apple doesn&rsquo;t need to build a search engine. Their lucrative partnership with Google, where Google pays a hefty sum to remain the default search engine on Apple devices, is a cash cow. This arrangement provides Apple with a steady stream of revenue without the headaches and risks associated with building and running their own search engine.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In essence, Apple has recognized that sometimes the best strategy is to double down on your strengths and forge strategic partnerships. By focusing on what they do best – creating beautiful, user-friendly devices and cultivating a loyal customer base – Apple can reap the rewards of the search market without getting their hands dirty.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This decision underscores Apple&rsquo;s pragmatic approach to business.

While the prospect of an Apple-branded search experience might pique the curiosity of tech enthusiasts, a closer look reveals this is a shrewd decision that aligns perfectly with Apple's core business strategy.</p><p>Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, recently filed a declaration, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-seeks-defend-googles-billion-dollar-payments-search-case-2024-12-24/\">reported by Reuters</a>, with a U.S. federal court outlining the company's rationale. Cue's arguments are compelling, painting a picture of a project fraught with challenges and misaligned with Apple's strengths, stating the following:</p><p><em>The development of a search engine would cost Apple \"billions of dollars\" and \"take many years,\" and this would divert investment money and employees away from \"other growth areas\" that the company is focused on.</em></p><p><em>The search business is \"rapidly evolving\" due to artificial intelligence, so it would be \"economically risky\" for Apple to create a search engine.</em></p><p><em>In order to create a \"viable\" search engine business, Apple would be required to \"sell targeted advertising,\" which is \"not a core business\" for the company and would go against its \"longstanding privacy commitments.\"</em></p><p><em>Apple does not have enough \"specialized professionals\" and \"operational infrastructure\" needed to build and run a successful search engine business.</em></p><p>But here's the kicker: Apple doesn't need to build a search engine. Their lucrative partnership with Google, where Google pays a hefty sum to remain the default search engine on Apple devices, is a cash cow. This arrangement provides Apple with a steady stream of revenue without the headaches and risks associated with building and running their own search engine.</p><p>In essence, Apple has recognized that sometimes the best strategy is to double down on your strengths and forge strategic partnerships. By focusing on what they do best – creating beautiful, user-friendly devices and cultivating a loyal customer base – Apple can reap the rewards of the search market without getting their hands dirty.</p><p>This decision underscores Apple's pragmatic approach to business. They understand that not every battle is worth fighting, and sometimes the most profitable path lies in collaboration, not competition. And with Google effectively bankrolling a significant portion of their business, it's a strategy that seems to be paying off handsomely.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>As we stand at the cusp of yet another technological shift, a sense of measured anticipation hangs in the air. The landscape, once dominated by rapid-fire innovation, feels strangely still. The once-revolutionary smartphone, now ubiquitous and indispensable, seems to have plateaued in its evolution. The explosive growth of software breakthroughs like cloud computing and social networks has matured into a steady, albeit less dramatic, upward trajectory.</p><p>This subtle transition period offers a moment for reflection, a chance to ponder the dynamics that drive innovation within the tech titans that shape our digital world. A recent conversation on \"The Diary of a CEO\" with former Google CEO Eric Schmidt offered a particularly insightful lens through which to examine these dynamics, specifically regarding the intricate dance between focus and expansion within large organizations.</p><p>Schmidt's tenure at Google coincided with a period of unprecedented growth and diversification. The company, emboldened by its dominance in search, ventured into a dizzying array of domains. The prevailing belief, as Schmidt articulated, was that Google, with its formidable infrastructure and vast reach, could conquer any market it chose to enter. This ambition, while understandable, presented a fundamental challenge: the tension between pursuing every opportunity and maintaining a laser-like focus on core strengths.</p><p>The rise of YouTube, which ultimately outmaneuvered Google's own video platform, served as a stark reminder of the agility and focused drive that smaller, nimbler startups possess. Large corporations, burdened by their own complexity, often struggle to pivot with the same speed and decisiveness.</p><p>Schmidt reflected on the age-old business school adage of streamlining product lines and focusing on a singular area of expertise. The example of Intel divesting itself of the ARM architecture, a decision that inadvertently sidelined them from the mobile revolution, underscored the potential pitfalls of oversimplification.</p><p>So, how does a company navigate this labyrinthine path between focused execution and expansive vision? Schmidt offered a compelling framework: envision the future. Project forward five years, he suggested, and map out the anticipated landscape. Take AI, for instance. How many players will be in the field? What will be the defining characteristics of the dominant companies? What platforms will reign supreme?</p><p>By meticulously constructing this future scenario, one can then work backward, identifying the strategic decisions and investments necessary to secure a position of strength within that evolving ecosystem. This \"future-back\" approach allows for a nuanced form of focus, one that doesn't blindly adhere to current product lines but instead anticipates and adapts to the inevitable shifts that lie ahead. It's about being selective and strategic in expansion to stay ahead of the curve. This is exactly what Google was doing while Eric Schmidt was there. The company wanted to be at the forefront of AI and was using that exact technique, which has led to Google being a major player in the AI space.</p><p>The tech world is in a perpetual state of flux. The challenge for industry leaders is not simply to react to these changes but to anticipate them, to shape the future rather than be shaped by it. Schmidt's insights remind us that true innovation requires a delicate balance between ambitious vision and strategic focus, guided by a clear-eyed understanding of the road ahead. It requires leaders to ask the right questions today, to secure their place in the tomorrows to come.</p><p>Head over to \"The Diary of a CEO\" and experience this insightful conversation for yourself. You won't be disappointed.</p><div id=\"youtube2-2Zg--ouGl7c\" class=\"youtube-wrap\" data-attrs=\"{\"videoId\":\"2Zg--ouGl7c\",\"startTime\":null,\"endTime\":null}\" data-component-name=\"Youtube2ToDOM\"><div class=\"youtube-inner\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2Zg--ouGl7c?rel=0&autoplay=0&showinfo=0&enablejsapi=0\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowautoplay=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"728\" height=\"409\"></iframe></div></div>\n",

It tells the true story of 855 Black women in the Army Corps who bravely joined the war effort during World War II. Facing a daunting backlog of mail that stretched back three years, these women confronted discrimination and the harsh realities of war-torn Europe.</p><p>Against all odds, they sorted over 17 million pieces of mail, delivering messages of hope and connection to soldiers and families back home. And they did it all ahead of schedule. \"The Six Triple Eight\" is a powerful testament to the strength, resilience, and often-unsung contributions of Black women during wartime. It's a must-watch.</p>\n",

Kind of reminded me of the Pixel C. The Pixel Tablet is perfect for pulling up multiview to watch my Commanders, managing our homes shopping list, quickly controlling the home smart devices, and keeping the conversation going in the kitchen while on Google Meet. It's like having an extra-large smart display that I can move wherever I want.</p><p>The Pixel Tablet starts at $499, and Google's been running some decent deals lately. I snagged mine with a $50 discount and a free case. If you're looking for a tablet that's both fun and functional, the Pixel Tablet is definitely worth checking out.</p>\n",

While Google plans to appeal the decision, it&rsquo;s also playing the game by proposing remedies to address the court&rsquo;s concerns.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In essence, the court found that Google&rsquo;s agreements with browser and device makers to feature its search engine as the default option were anti-competitive.

A court recently took issue with the tech giant's search distribution contracts, essentially saying they stifle competition. While Google plans to appeal the decision, it's also playing the game by proposing remedies to address the court's concerns.</p><p>In essence, the court found that Google's agreements with browser and device makers to feature its search engine as the default option were anti-competitive. Google, naturally, disagrees, arguing its dominance stems from building a superior product and making savvy business decisions.</p><p>Now, before you picture Google being carved up like a Thanksgiving turkey, let me tell you about <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/\">their proposed remedies</a>. They're actually quite interesting.</p><h2>The Gist of Google's Proposal</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Browsers get more freedom:</strong> Companies like Apple and Mozilla can still make deals with Google Search, but they'll have more flexibility. They can set different default search engines for different platforms (like iPhones versus iPads) and browsing modes. Plus, they can change their default search provider at least every 12 months.</p></li><li><p><strong>Android gets unbundled:</strong> Device makers will have more flexibility in preloading multiple search engines and Google apps. This means you might see more variety on your Android home screen, and competitors like Microsoft get a fairer shot at placement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Oversight without overreach:</strong> Google proposes a system to ensure compliance with the court's order, but without giving the government excessive control over your online experience.</p></li></ul><h2>My Two Cents</h2><p>Frankly, these seem like reasonable proposals. It's like Google is saying, \"Okay, we hear you, but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater.\" They acknowledge the need for a more level playing field while still protecting their hard-earned innovations.</p><p>The idea of platform-specific search defaults is particularly intriguing. Imagine your iPhone defaulting to DuckDuckGo for privacy, while your iPad sticks with Google for its familiar interface. This kind of flexibility could empower users and foster competition.</p><p>Unbundling search from other Google apps on Android is also a smart move. It addresses a key complaint from competitors while giving users more choice.</p><p>Of course, the devil is in the details. We'll have to see how these proposals play out in practice. But at first glance, Google seems to be striking a balance between addressing antitrust concerns and preserving its ability to innovate.</p><p>While Google's proposals sound good on paper, I'll be watching closely to see how they impact consumers in the real world. Will we truly see more choice and competition in the search market? Or will Google find clever ways to maintain its dominance? Only time will tell.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This blog post reflects my personal opinions and should not be taken as legal or financial advice.</p>\n",

As a Pixel 9 Pro user myself, I was especially hyped to see Google finally getting some serious recognition.</p><p>Here's the rundown:</p><ul><li><p>&nbsp;<strong>Best Big Phone:</strong> Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra (no surprise there)</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;<strong>Best Small Phone</strong>: iPhone 16 (again, expected)</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;<strong>Best Camera:</strong> iPhone 16 Pro (sigh... Apple still holds this one)</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;<strong>Best Value:</strong> Nothing Phone 2A (good to see some disruptors!)</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;<strong>Best Battery:</strong> Red Magic 10 Pro (gaming phones FTW!)</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;<strong>Best Design: </strong>Huawei Mate Xt (that fold is sleek)</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;<strong>Best Foldable: </strong>Pixel 9 Pro Fold! (YES!)</p></li><li><p><strong>&nbsp;Most Improved:</strong> Pixel 9 Pro Fold! (DOUBLE YES!)</p></li><li><p><strong>&nbsp;Bust of the Year:</strong> Asus Zenphone 11 Ultra (ouch)</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;<strong>MVP Phone of the Year:</strong> Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra (Samsung takes it again)</p></li></ul><p>While I'm a bit bummed the Pixel didn't snag the overall MVP, those Foldable wins are HUGE. I've been rocking the Pixel 9 Pro for months now, and it's the best phone I've ever used. The camera is fantastic (even if not \"the best\"), the battery lasts forever, and the software is smooth as butter. Marques himself uses the 9 Pro XL as his daily driver, which says something.</p><p>If you're looking for a phone that does it all, with a killer foldable option, Google's finally stepped up to the plate. Check out the full video for Marques' in-depth thoughts, but consider this your <strong>TL;DR: Pixel's a contender now, folks.</strong></p><a class=\"image-link image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2LEX5u3oxExBJY1M7YSUp5yH5PCnLOvMLCEaS6Nnz_wWQnbokd4J0c9MsTfpT6SKOQ4cfrOLpznCg_qCVOO181UxoATGPWQ34r1tMZiuJbIXAql5xgHcwkvrCu_Lg9octvsuMkMF4GNHckTxaYp0Jk3hTOW2vhAAXuXNGFf_U21QXaXQmZ18YDfK2RYd0/s2560/1000000626.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8eddf80-b8a9-4b0e-9214-3d1bae1f4e10_640x266.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8eddf80-b8a9-4b0e-9214-3d1bae1f4e10_640x266.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8eddf80-b8a9-4b0e-9214-3d1bae1f4e10_640x266.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8eddf80-b8a9-4b0e-9214-3d1bae1f4e10_640x266.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/https3a2f2fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2fpublic2fimages2fb8eddf80-b.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"266\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"[substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/im...](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b8eddf80-b8a9-4b0e-9214-3d1bae1f4e10_640x266.png)\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":266,\"width\":640,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":null,\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2LEX5u3oxExBJY1M7YSUp5yH5PCnLOvMLCEaS6Nnz_wWQnbokd4J0c9MsTfpT6SKOQ4cfrOLpznCg_qCVOO181UxoATGPWQ34r1tMZiuJbIXAql5xgHcwkvrCu_Lg9octvsuMkMF4GNHckTxaYp0Jk3hTOW2vhAAXuXNGFf_U21QXaXQmZ18YDfK2RYd0/s2560/1000000626.png\",\"belowTheFold\":false,\"topImage\":true,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8eddf80-b8a9-4b0e-9214-3d1bae1f4e10_640x266.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8eddf80-b8a9-4b0e-9214-3d1bae1f4e10_640x266.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8eddf80-b8a9-4b0e-9214-3d1bae1f4e10_640x266.png 1272w, https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/https3a2f2fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2fpublic2fimages2fb8eddf80-b.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></picture><div></div></div></a>\n",
