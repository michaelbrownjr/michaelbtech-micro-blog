				"title": "Dear Google: Let’s Talk About the Pixel (Comments from Reddit)",
				"content_html": "<p>A 13 year long iPhone customer, finally made the switch from iPhone to the Google Pixel 9 Pro and he shared some great feedback about his experience using Pixel. Some of them are just the difference from being in a closed-ecosystem, controlled by one company and moving to a more open-ecosystem semi-controlled by one company, but with the philosophy of an open-ecosystem. If that makes sense. I provided <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jj644v/comment/mjowpaw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\">my comments</a> to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jj644v/dear_google_lets_talk_about_the_pixel/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\">the person&rsquo;s post on reddit</a>. I&rsquo;ve share them below. The original redditor&rsquo;s comments are in the green. Mine are in between. Enjoy.</p>\n<p>I love all of these suggestions and would welcome all of these, but I&rsquo;d like to share my thoughts on these. I&rsquo;ll skip the first one since that was positive feedback.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2. <strong>Improve the Tensor Chip</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make the Tensor chip as fast as the top-tier Snapdragon or the latest iPhone’s chip. I’ve noticed some lag, especially when gaming. Sure, 99% of people don’t game heavily on their phones, but when you have an iPhone, you know it can handle it if you want. That’s a feeling of security.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this is coming with time. Both Qualcomm and Apple have been making their own chips for more than a decade now. Google partnering with Samsung in their Tensor White Chapel and newer chips was to jumpstart Google&rsquo;s experience in making their own chips, while still being able to customize the and tweak the AI experience on their own devices. Similar to how Apple learned from Intel before switching to their own silicon. Overall, I think this is coming, but with a caveat. Google will more than likely rely on the combination and collaboration of Cloud computing. So raw power locally won&rsquo;t always been the focus. Especially since it requires a whole lot more R&amp;D, will eat into margins, and they&rsquo;ll more than likely raise the price of devices even more than the usual economical increases.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>3. <strong>Enhance Video Recording</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You guys take incredible photos, so keep it up. But please work on getting the video quality closer to iPhone levels—especially when switching lenses mid-recording.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think you&rsquo;re right on with this and I think Google is surely advancing here. Even <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/how-google-built-tensor-g5-3535489/#:~:text=The%20Tensor%20G5%20will%20have%20a%20fully%20custom%20ISP%20from%20the%20front%2Dend%20to%20the%20back%2Dend%20parts%20of%20the%20pipeline\">adding their own custom ISP</a> as well as replace &ldquo;BigWave&rdquo; (Google&rsquo;s in-house video codec) with WAVE677DV suggesting that the latter may offer advantages in areas such as performance, power efficiency, or a combination of factors, along with the added benefit of multi-format support on the new Tensor G5 chip coming this fall.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4. <strong>Optimize Your Own Apps</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some Google apps are smoother on iPhone than on Pixel. Why is Google Maps smoother on iPhone, for example? Please optimize your apps to perform best on your own phone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve actually found Google Maps works better on Pixel than it has on iPhone. At least for me in the past. This is obviously anecdotal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5. <strong>Get Third-Party Apps Onboard</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make sure popular social media and messaging apps are optimized for Pixel. This is crucial for everyday use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I want this to, and Google has worked with IG, Snap, and the YouTube team for a few years and has added some exclusives that aren&rsquo;t available on iOS. Like Night Sight in Instagram, Live video switching between Pixel&rsquo;s, and Live Transcribe. Still there is a lot more work that needs to be done and the CameraX API is the key. Fragmentation is the issue here and Google having to balance prioritizing Pixel or Android comes into play.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>6. <strong>Merge Google Meet &amp; Messages</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Consider blending Google Meet and Google Messages into one seamless experience (similar to FaceTime, iMessages). It would simplify communication across Android ecosystem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From my understanding, it&rsquo;s the same. Messages and Facetime are two completely different apps. You can uninstall Facetime and still have Messages. I assume that when you can uninstall Messages on iOS, you can still use Facetime. I might not fully understand what you mean here, but I think they are pretty similar. I think WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal are the only ones that truly have it blended. But, AFAIK Google Meet and Google Messages are to what Apple Facetime and Apple Messages are today in terms as a seamless experience.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>7. <strong>Add Built-In Magnets</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Implement magnets inside the phone (like MagSafe on iPhone). There are tons of accessories that rely on this feature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not opposed to this, but is it absolutely needed? Most people have a case on their phone. Does the Pixel need magnets if more cases have magnets? I think that&rsquo;s up for debate. I know a lot of people like to go caseless, but anecdotally, for every caseless courageous person I see in public, I see 10 cas(r)eful cautious people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>8. <strong>Strengthen the Ecosystem</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One major reason people stick with iPhone is because of Apple’s ecosystem. Web apps are fine, but if possible, create native desktop apps (Messages, video calling, Notes, Reminders, Calendar, Photos, etc.) for both Mac and Windows. That would help lure more people in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Would native desktop apps do that? Why? To what metric? What benefit do customers get from having a native Messages app as opposed to a Web one? Web apps don&rsquo;t take up space on the local machine and web apps can be wherever you are. If the features are consistent between the two, I don&rsquo;t see the want and need for that.</p>\n<p>As for the ecosystem, I agree, and that definitely takes a lot more time because Google can&rsquo;t and probably won&rsquo;t force any OEM, Developer, etc&hellip; to do things that solely benefit Google. <a href=\"https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones\">Apple can and does do that </a>at the expense of third-party accessory makers and developers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>9. <strong>Bolster Core Android Features</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Keep improving Android at its core. Make it even more robust, smooth, and user-friendly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No notes. This is good. Progression is good.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>10. <strong>Elevate the Watch Experience</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Pixel Watch needs more attention. Aim to match (or beat) the Apple Watch’s functionality, integration, and polish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hear this a lot but I don&rsquo;t think people are ready to spend $700 to $800 on a Pixel Watch. It&rsquo;s still new and getting as many Pixel Watch experiences out of the door as possibly is more important with the balance of providing premium fitness experiences. I think for Google only having made 3 watches, they&rsquo;ve done great. Remember, Samsung and Apple have had watch accessory businesses for at least 10 years. That comes with time, but Pixel is advancing at a fast pace. With all that said, I do think the Pixel Watch needs smoother animations and better loading performance. UX journey in and out of apps need to be a lot more polished with animations coming from a specific point on the screen instead of just appearing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lastly, a Big One:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Google is known for killing projects quickly, which might be great for engineers, but from a customer’s standpoint, it shows a lack of long-term commitment. When you launch something, it’s hard for us to fully adopt it because we suspect it’ll be discontinued. That attitude does more harm to your reputation than anything else. Please rethink it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I <strong>LOVE</strong> this one and totally agree. I think because of the massive backlash and killing of extra weight/messaging apps, Google is at a lean place that seems to be holding on to things as they are today. Google Assistant going away isn&rsquo;t a killing. It&rsquo;s an evolution. However, there are times where it makes sense to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/18/should-apple-kill-siri/\">kill something that just isn&rsquo;t working or hasn&rsquo;t been working for years now</a>.</p>\n<p>This is great feedback from a long-time iPhone customer. Some things just don&rsquo;t apply to Android and even Google. I will say, though, that if you expect Google to completely control and force their hand on things like Apple does, you will be disappointed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/hq720.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n",

The post provides a detailed look at the pros and cons of switching to iPhone after being a long-time Android user. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the user&rsquo;s observations, and my own perspective.</p>\n<h1 id=\"analyzing-the-good\">Analyzing &ldquo;The Good&rdquo;</h1>\n<p>Pucky22 highlighting several positive aspects of the iPhone 16 Pro:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hardware Quality</strong>: A really nice piece of hardware. Beautiful, solid, and feels great in hand. The Pro model is a good size—big but not too bulky.</p>\n<p><strong>Screen</strong>: Looks fantastic. No complaints.</p>\n<p><strong>Camera &amp; Video</strong>: Takes excellent shots, and from all accounts, the video quality is top-tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic Island</strong>: First time hearing about it, but it’s actually pretty cool. Having sports scores and music controls right there is surprisingly useful.</p>\n<p><strong>Software Touches</strong>: Some effects and animations are really smooth—like when scanning a document, it isolates the background and seamlessly moves it into the corner.</p>\n<p><strong>CarPlay</strong>: This surprised me. When catching up on notifications, it gives a natural-language summary of missed messages, which is really nice.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Apple Maps</strong> navigation voice and style is very natural and smooth—I actually prefer it to Google Maps. I guess the days of being navigated into a lake are over for Apple Maps!</p>\n<p><strong>Grouped Notifications</strong>: While I still think Android does notifications better, Apple’s grouping and summarization of same-app notifications is intelligently designed and useful.</p>\n<p><strong>FaceID</strong>: When you’re holding the phone, FaceID works perfectly—fast and accurate. However, if the phone is sitting on a desk or table, FaceID often won’t pick up your face unless you awkwardly lean over it. A fingerprint reader would be a really nice option in those situations.</p>\n<p><strong>Standby Mode</strong>: Standby mode at night, with the bedside alarm clock in red, was actually very nice and well-designed. It’s subtle but easy to read at night without being harsh on the eyes. Also, the default iPhone alarm tone is exceptionally pleasing—way better than the jarring tones I’m used to on Android.</p>\n<p><strong>GenMoji Seems Fun</strong>: I didn’t even try it once, but I bet it’s cool for those who are into that sort of thing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pucky22 praised the iPhone&rsquo;s hardware, display, and camera, and found features like Dynamic Island and CarPlay&rsquo;s notification summaries to be surprisingly useful. They also noted the smooth software animations, improved Apple Maps, and well-designed Standby Mode. All of those to which I also share the same sentiment.</p>\n<h1 id=\"analyzing-the-bad\">Analyzing &ldquo;The Bad&rdquo;</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, the user&rsquo;s experience wasn&rsquo;t entirely positive. The user encountered several significant issues with iOS.</p>\n<p>These aren’t new complaints about iOS, but for someone using it as a main device, they are massive hurdles.</p>\n<p><strong>The Keyboard is Borderline Unusable</strong>. Whether using the stock keyboard or Gboard on iOS, the experience is awful. So many typos, wrong key presses—it’s just bad. The Gboard on my old Pixel 7 was 1000x more accurate and faster to type on. It has been consistently infuriating. I had no idea just how much better the Android keyboard was.</p>\n<p><strong>Notifications = Anxiety Machine</strong>. iPhone is aggressive with notifications—way more than I was used to. On Android, you can easily choose which notifications for a given app should be silent or not, right from the notification itself—just a quick tap and done. On iPhone, it’s a much more laborious process, requiring you to dig into settings manually for each app. This makes it way harder to fine-tune notifications to be useful instead of overwhelming.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of Settings…</strong> Why is there a whole app called “Settings” instead of just swiping down and tapping an icon to adjust things quickly? Having to navigate through an app for simple things like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is an unnecessary step.</p>\n<p><strong>No App Drawer</strong>. This is insane. Instead of a clean app drawer, you have to either search for apps (which is fine but not intuitive) or look through Apple&rsquo;s pre-made categories in the App Library. The grouping seems neat at first glance but ends up being a wild choice in actual use. Why do I have to rely on Apple to decide where my apps go?</p>\n<p><strong>CarPlay Layout is a Mess</strong>. Apple Maps is actually pretty solid now—natural-sounding navigation, accurate directions—but the overall CarPlay interface is clunky compared to Android Auto.If you use Google Maps on CarPlay (without a car screen, just on your phone), you can only get in-app media controls for Spotify or Apple Music—not YouTube Music. Why??</p>\n<p><strong>iMessage is Seriously Underwhelming</strong>. I was expecting more. RCS on Android does the same thing (minus the blue bubble “exclusivity”), so the fact that Apple has built an entire bullying ecosystem around this feels ridiculous. WhatsApp does all of this and works across devices.</p>\n<p><strong>No iMessage on a PC?</strong> This was a shock. I use a PC for work, and I was stunned to realize that iMessage has no web or Windows version. With Google Messages, WhatsApp, or basically any other modern messaging platform, I could just open a browser and continue conversations while working. With iPhone? Nope. Either use a Mac or be stuck switching between my phone and computer constantly.</p>\n<p><strong>Transferring Old Messages From Android Was a Nightmare</strong>. This was infuriating.

While the hardware and some software features are impressive, iOS has significant usability issues. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the premium Android smartphone market is much stronger now than it once was. Companies like Google, Samsung, OnePlus, and Motorola have really stepped up, offering compelling alternatives in the high-end segment. So now when people ask me why I no longer use an iPhone.

				"content_html": "<h2 id=\"googles-daily-listen-your-discover-feed-now-in-audio\">Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;Daily Listen&rdquo;: Your Discover Feed, Now in Audio</h2>\n<p>Google is constantly experimenting with ways to make information more accessible and digestible. The latest foray into this arena comes in the form of &ldquo;Daily Listen,&rdquo; an experimental feature tucked away in Google Discover within Google&rsquo;s Search Labs. Imagine transforming your personalized Discover feed into a short, easily consumable audio podcast – that&rsquo;s the core concept behind Daily Listen.\r\rHere&rsquo;s a quick breakdown of &ldquo;What it is&rdquo;, &ldquo;How it works&rdquo;, and &ldquo;How Pixel customers can use it&rdquo;:\r\r* <strong>What it is:</strong>\r\r    * It&rsquo;s an AI-powered audio experience that provides a brief, roughly five-minute summary of the topics you&rsquo;re interested in, based directly on your Google Discover feed. Think of it as a personalized news bulletin curated by your own browsing habits.\r    * Essentially, it&rsquo;s an audio version of your Discover feed, perfect for catching up on the go, during your commute, or while multitasking. I&rsquo;ve personally found that these small, bite-sized, consumable podcasts are incredibly useful. Services like &ldquo;Daily Listen&rdquo; fulfill that niche of providing just enough information without the fluff that often bogs down longer-form content. Look at the success of podcasts like TechMeme Ride Home and even the long-running &ldquo;MacOS Ken&rdquo; - concise, informative briefings are a real win.\r\r* <strong>How it works:</strong>\r\r    * It uses AI to gather and summarize content from your Discover feed, creating a personalized podcast episode. The magic goes deeper than simple text-to-speech. The AI is likely leveraging techniques like:\r        * <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> To understand the core themes and key arguments within the articles in your feed.\r        * <strong>Summarization Algorithms:</strong> To condense longer articles into concise and digestible snippets, capturing the essence of the information.\r        * <strong>Topic Modeling:</strong> To identify recurring themes and group related content, ensuring the audio episode is coherent and well-structured.\r        * <strong>Voice Cloning or Text-to-Speech (TTS) with Style Transfer:</strong> Although not confirmed, it is possible Google is experimenting with using voice cloning to produce more natural sounding &ldquo;Daily Listen&rdquo; content, potentially with subtle inflections based on the tone of the original article. Another possibility is employing style transfer to adjust the TTS&rsquo;s pitch and tone for a more human-like reading, instead of a robotic one.\r    * The content selection is based on your search history and interactions with the Discover feed. This means the algorithm considers:\r        * <strong>Keywords in your searches:</strong> What you&rsquo;ve actively looked for provides explicit signals about your interests.\r        * <strong>Websites you frequently visit:</strong> If you&rsquo;re a regular reader of a particular news site or blog, content from that source is more likely to appear.\r        * <strong>Topics you&rsquo;ve engaged with in Discover:</strong> Articles you&rsquo;ve clicked on, shared, or saved are strong indicators of your preferences.\r        * <strong>Feedback you&rsquo;ve provided:</strong> Clicking &ldquo;More like this&rdquo; or &ldquo;Less like this&rdquo; on Discover cards directly influences future content recommendations.\r\r    * <strong>Technical Analysis Considerations:</strong> The back-end likely utilizes a combination of Google&rsquo;s existing AI infrastructure, possibly leveraging TensorFlow or similar frameworks. The system would need to continuously monitor and update your profile of interests in real-time, re-running the summarization and aggregation algorithms each time a new Daily Listen is generated.

				"content_text": "## Google's \"Daily Listen\": Your Discover Feed, Now in Audio\r\n\r\nGoogle is constantly experimenting with ways to make information more accessible and digestible. The latest foray into this arena comes in the form of \"Daily Listen,\" an experimental feature tucked away in Google Discover within Google's Search Labs. Imagine transforming your personalized Discover feed into a short, easily consumable audio podcast – that's the core concept behind Daily Listen.\r\rHere's a quick breakdown of \"What it is\", \"How it works\", and \"How Pixel customers can use it\":\r\r* **What it is:**\r\r    * It's an AI-powered audio experience that provides a brief, roughly five-minute summary of the topics you're interested in, based directly on your Google Discover feed. Think of it as a personalized news bulletin curated by your own browsing habits.\r    * Essentially, it's an audio version of your Discover feed, perfect for catching up on the go, during your commute, or while multitasking. I've personally found that these small, bite-sized, consumable podcasts are incredibly useful. Services like \"Daily Listen\" fulfill that niche of providing just enough information without the fluff that often bogs down longer-form content. Look at the success of podcasts like TechMeme Ride Home and even the long-running \"MacOS Ken\" - concise, informative briefings are a real win.\r\r* **How it works:**\r\r    * It uses AI to gather and summarize content from your Discover feed, creating a personalized podcast episode. The magic goes deeper than simple text-to-speech. The AI is likely leveraging techniques like:\r        * **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** To understand the core themes and key arguments within the articles in your feed.\r        * **Summarization Algorithms:** To condense longer articles into concise and digestible snippets, capturing the essence of the information.\r        * **Topic Modeling:** To identify recurring themes and group related content, ensuring the audio episode is coherent and well-structured.\r        * **Voice Cloning or Text-to-Speech (TTS) with Style Transfer:** Although not confirmed, it is possible Google is experimenting with using voice cloning to produce more natural sounding \"Daily Listen\" content, potentially with subtle inflections based on the tone of the original article. Another possibility is employing style transfer to adjust the TTS's pitch and tone for a more human-like reading, instead of a robotic one.\r    * The content selection is based on your search history and interactions with the Discover feed. This means the algorithm considers:\r        * **Keywords in your searches:** What you've actively looked for provides explicit signals about your interests.\r        * **Websites you frequently visit:** If you're a regular reader of a particular news site or blog, content from that source is more likely to appear.\r        * **Topics you've engaged with in Discover:** Articles you've clicked on, shared, or saved are strong indicators of your preferences.\r        * **Feedback you've provided:** Clicking \"More like this\" or \"Less like this\" on Discover cards directly influences future content recommendations.\r\r    * **Technical Analysis Considerations:** The back-end likely utilizes a combination of Google's existing AI infrastructure, possibly leveraging TensorFlow or similar frameworks. The system would need to continuously monitor and update your profile of interests in real-time, re-running the summarization and aggregation algorithms each time a new Daily Listen is generated. This necessitates significant computational power and optimized algorithms to deliver the five-minute summary efficiently. Furthermore, the system would require efficient caching mechanisms to prevent redundant processing for users with relatively stable browsing habits.\r* **How Pixel customers can use it:**\r\r    * First, users must opt-in to Search Labs within the Google app. Open the Google app, tap your profile picture, go to \"Settings,\" then \"Search Labs,\" and enable \"Daily Listen.\"\r    * Once enabled, a \"Daily Listen\" card will appear in the Discover feed. The appearance and frequency of this card may vary depending on the availability of relevant content and the algorithm's confidence in its relevance to your interests.\r    * Tapping the card generates the personalized audio episode. The AI then springs into action, compiling and narrating the audio summary.\r    * The user will then have audio control functions, such as pause, rewind, and fast forward, allowing for a user-friendly and adaptable listening experience.\r\r**Daily Listen and the Potential Connection to Notebook LM:**\r\rWhile not explicitly stated, it's intriguing to consider the potential relationship between Daily Listen and Google's Notebook LM (formerly Project Tailwind).

				"title": "Google's Grand Experiment: From Energy to Ecosystem—A 13-Year Observation",
				"content_html": "<p>Thirteen years ago, as a GeekSquad Advanced Repair Agent, I saw Chromebooks for what they were: cheap, $200 laptops with a measly 16GB of storage. <em>Thin clients</em>, the IT crowd called them. I called them underwhelming. <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/reviews/samsung-chromebook-series-5-review/#:~:text=You%20can%20do%20a%20lot%20of%20things%20with%20one%20of%20those%20(or%20a%20smartphone%2C%20an%20Android%20tablet%2C%20or%20iPad%20for%20that%20matter).%20Right%20now%2C%20though%2C%20there%20are%20just%20a%20lot%20of%20things%20you%20can%27t%20do%20with%20a%20Chromebook.\">Many other&rsquo;s thought the same.</a> Back then, <a href=\"https://cloud.googleblog.com/2012/01/bringing-chromebooks-to-every-classroom.html?m=1\">Google&rsquo;s cloud ambitions manifested as these bare-bones machines</a>—a far cry from the integrated ecosystems I was used to, dominated by Macs and PCs. I knew Google made Android and those software services—Search, Docs, Sheets, Slides—they were fine. But the big picture? I missed it. Google didn&rsquo;t <em>build</em> hardware like Apple did. To me, they were just… energy. Pure potential, no form. Steve Jobs said computers are a bicycle for the mind. Google was the kinetic energy pushing the bike, not the bike itself. In this analysis, I want to trace Google&rsquo;s evolution from that pure energy to a company building the bike, the road, the pedals—even the rider.</p>\n<p>The shift in my perspective came when I grasped the consumer side of cloud computing—servers, racks, the whole &lsquo;someone else&rsquo;s computer&rsquo; spiel. Suddenly, Chromebooks started to make sense. <em>Cost-effective</em>, they said. <em>All the heavy lifting on Google&rsquo;s servers</em>, they said. Naïve as I was, I hadn&rsquo;t yet fully registered Google&rsquo;s underlying ad-driven empire, the <em>real</em> reason behind the Chromebook push. That revelation led me to a stint as a regional Chromebook rep. A role masquerading as tech, but really, it was sales with a side of jargon. The training retreat? Let&rsquo;s call it an indoctrination session. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEr4j8kgwOk\">&lsquo;Moonshot Thinking&rsquo;</a> video from Google [X]—all inspiration, no product—was the hook. Suddenly, streaming movies and collaborative docs weren&rsquo;t just features, they were <em>visions</em>. &lsquo;Moonshot thinking,&rsquo; I told myself, swallowing the Kool-Aid. Cloud computing, in that moment, seemed revolutionary. I even had &lsquo;office hours&rsquo; with Docs project managers, peppering them with questions about real-time collaboration. &lsquo;What if someone pastes the same URL?&rsquo; I asked, probably driving them nuts. But I was hooked. Cloud computing, I thought, was the future—or so they wanted me to believe.</p>\n<p>That journey, from wide-eyed newbie to… well, slightly less wide-eyed observer, has taught me one thing: Google&rsquo;s Achilles' heel is execution. They&rsquo;ve got the vision, the talent, the <em>sheer audacity</em>—but putting it all together? That&rsquo;s where they stumble. Only in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22864892/google-2022-ecosystem-android-chromebook-ces-features\">the last three years</a> have they even <em>attempted</em> to wrangle their disparate hardware, software, cloud, and AI efforts into a coherent whole. Too little, too late? Perhaps. Look at the Pixel team: a frantic scramble to catch up, <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2025/01/30/pixel-android-voluntary-exit-employees/\">complete with a Jobsian purge of the &lsquo;unpassionate.'</a> Rick Osterloh, a charming and knowledgeable figurehead, no doubt—but is he a ruthless enough leader? <em>That&rsquo;s</em> the question. He&rsquo;s managed to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24133881/google-android-pixel-teams-reorg-rick-osterloh\">corral the Platform and Services division</a>. Yet, the ecosystem still feels… scattered. The Pixel hardware, for all its promise, still reeks of a <a href=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/02/24/googles-pixels-are-apples-tvs.html\">&lsquo;side project&rsquo;</a>—a lavish, expensive, and perpetually unfinished side project. The pieces are there, scattered across the table. Can Google finally assemble the puzzle, or will they forever be a company of impressive parts, but no cohesive whole?</p>\n<p>After over a decade of observing Google&rsquo;s trajectory, certain patterns emerge. Chromebooks (bless their budget-friendly hearts), for instance, have settled comfortably into the budget lane: affordable laptops for grade schoolers and retirees. <em>Hardly</em> the &lsquo;sexy&rsquo; category Apple&rsquo;s M-series or those Windows CoPilot ARM machines occupy, <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-plus-google/\">is it</a>?

				"content_text": "Thirteen years ago, as a GeekSquad Advanced Repair Agent, I saw Chromebooks for what they were: cheap, $200 laptops with a measly 16GB of storage. *Thin clients*, the IT crowd called them. I called them underwhelming. [Many other's thought the same.](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/samsung-chromebook-series-5-review/#:~:text=You%20can%20do%20a%20lot%20of%20things%20with%20one%20of%20those%20(or%20a%20smartphone%2C%20an%20Android%20tablet%2C%20or%20iPad%20for%20that%20matter).%20Right%20now%2C%20though%2C%20there%20are%20just%20a%20lot%20of%20things%20you%20can%27t%20do%20with%20a%20Chromebook.) Back then, [Google's cloud ambitions manifested as these bare-bones machines](https://cloud.googleblog.com/2012/01/bringing-chromebooks-to-every-classroom.html?m=1)—a far cry from the integrated ecosystems I was used to, dominated by Macs and PCs. I knew Google made Android and those software services—Search, Docs, Sheets, Slides—they were fine. But the big picture? I missed it. Google didn't *build* hardware like Apple did. To me, they were just… energy. Pure potential, no form. Steve Jobs said computers are a bicycle for the mind. Google was the kinetic energy pushing the bike, not the bike itself. In this analysis, I want to trace Google's evolution from that pure energy to a company building the bike, the road, the pedals—even the rider.\n\n\nThe shift in my perspective came when I grasped the consumer side of cloud computing—servers, racks, the whole 'someone else's computer' spiel. Suddenly, Chromebooks started to make sense. *Cost-effective*, they said. *All the heavy lifting on Google's servers*, they said. Naïve as I was, I hadn't yet fully registered Google's underlying ad-driven empire, the *real* reason behind the Chromebook push. That revelation led me to a stint as a regional Chromebook rep. A role masquerading as tech, but really, it was sales with a side of jargon. The training retreat? Let's call it an indoctrination session. The ['Moonshot Thinking'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEr4j8kgwOk) video from Google [X]—all inspiration, no product—was the hook. Suddenly, streaming movies and collaborative docs weren't just features, they were *visions*. 'Moonshot thinking,' I told myself, swallowing the Kool-Aid. Cloud computing, in that moment, seemed revolutionary. I even had 'office hours' with Docs project managers, peppering them with questions about real-time collaboration. 'What if someone pastes the same URL?' I asked, probably driving them nuts. But I was hooked. Cloud computing, I thought, was the future—or so they wanted me to believe.\n\n\n\n\nThat journey, from wide-eyed newbie to… well, slightly less wide-eyed observer, has taught me one thing: Google's Achilles' heel is execution. They've got the vision, the talent, the *sheer audacity*—but putting it all together? That's where they stumble. Only in [the last three years](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22864892/google-2022-ecosystem-android-chromebook-ces-features) have they even *attempted* to wrangle their disparate hardware, software, cloud, and AI efforts into a coherent whole. Too little, too late? Perhaps. Look at the Pixel team: a frantic scramble to catch up, [complete with a Jobsian purge of the 'unpassionate.'](https://9to5google.com/2025/01/30/pixel-android-voluntary-exit-employees/) Rick Osterloh, a charming and knowledgeable figurehead, no doubt—but is he a ruthless enough leader? *That's* the question. He's managed to [corral the Platform and Services division](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24133881/google-android-pixel-teams-reorg-rick-osterloh). Yet, the ecosystem still feels… scattered. The Pixel hardware, for all its promise, still reeks of a ['side project'](https://blog.michaelbtech.com/2025/02/24/googles-pixels-are-apples-tvs.html)—a lavish, expensive, and perpetually unfinished side project. The pieces are there, scattered across the table. Can Google finally assemble the puzzle, or will they forever be a company of impressive parts, but no cohesive whole?\n\n\n\n\nAfter over a decade of observing Google's trajectory, certain patterns emerge. Chromebooks (bless their budget-friendly hearts), for instance, have settled comfortably into the budget lane: affordable laptops for grade schoolers and retirees. *Hardly* the 'sexy' category Apple's M-series or those Windows CoPilot ARM machines occupy, [is it](https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-plus-google/)? Google's Nest, meanwhile, *envisioned* ambient computing years ago. Yet,[ Amazon's Alexa+ seems to be delivering](https://www.threads.net/@panospanay/post/DG1DrgAypzL?xmt=AQGzS9MJYFBSnLZhfQRrSs7yxSRdj2F7kUbefTchTVf86Q) on that promise while Google's vision gathers dust. And let's talk apps: Google's own, some of the most popular on both Android and iOS, often *perform better on iOS*. Yes, that's changing—slowly. And the messaging app graveyard? Overblown, some say. I say, try herding a family group chat through Google's ever-shifting messaging landscape. Musical chairs, indeed.

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://docs.bsky.app/blog/2025-protocol-roadmap-spring\">Bluesky has just unveiled its 2025 roadmap for the AT Protocol</a>, outlining some pretty significant changes aimed at making the platform smoother and more secure. Essentially, they&rsquo;re fine-tuning the entire system. A key focus is on streamlining data synchronization with the Sync v1.1 update, which will make running relays more efficient and clarify the process for validating the firehose. Think of it as optimizing the backbone of the network, ensuring everything runs smoothly. As someone who&rsquo;s been exploring both AT Protocol and ActivityPub clients, I&rsquo;m particularly interested in seeing how these improvements will help bridge the gap towards a truly functional fediverse. Currently, ActivityPub boasts a larger ecosystem of clients and more established connectivity.</p>\n<p>Security is also a major priority, with the introduction of Auth Scopes. This feature will give users much more granular control over app permissions. For example, you’ll be able to allow an app to read your posts without granting access to your direct messages. It’s about putting you firmly in the driver&rsquo;s seat when it comes to your data. Developers are getting some love too, with a new web interface for PDS account management. This will simplify the process of building apps on the AT Protocol, making it easier for new users to sign up and manage their accounts.</p>\n<p>Bluesky is also prioritizing the development of features for <strong>private groups</strong> and <strong>encrypted messages</strong>. They’re aiming to enable users to share content with specific audiences and keep it truly private, addressing a major demand for enhanced privacy. They’re also cleaning up the protocol by deprecating older features, ensuring everyone is using the latest and most efficient tools.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We believe that robust support for group-private data will be necessary for the long-term success of the protocol (and for apps built on the protocol). Similarly, the ability to share private content with a specific group or audience continues to be a top feature request for both the AT Protocol and the Bluesky app. Just as we’re currently doing with public conversation on the Bluesky app and the AT Protocol, we also want to co-design the protocol specification for private data in tandem with specific real-world product features: this results in better outcomes for both. Designing for privacy is pretty different from designing for global broadcast, and we think the data architecture will probably look pretty different from the MST + firehose system.</p>\n<p>Shared data will depend on Auth Scopes, and we don&rsquo;t expect to start design work until that is complete.</p>\n<p>Looking forward, we continue to have plans to implement on-protocol DMs and E2EE group chat. However, we don’t expect to start work on this until after shared data is implemented. Meanwhile, there has been exciting progress in the broader tech world around the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) standard, and we are optimistic that we will be able to build on reusable components and design patterns when the time comes. It is also possible (and exciting!) that the atproto dev community will experiment and build E2EE chat apps off-protocol before there is an official specification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The AT Protocol community continues to grow rapidly, and Bluesky encourages everyone to get involved through GitHub discussions and community events. It’s a collaborative effort, and the company is clearly committed to building a robust and user-friendly decentralized social network.

As<a href=\"https://www.cleverpodcast.com/blog/ep-89-ivy-ross\"> Ivy Ross, Google&rsquo;s Head of Hardware Design, put it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;How do you translate the sentiment associated with Google—human, optimistic, bold–into color, texture and form?&rsquo; That&rsquo;s exactly what they&rsquo;ve been doing, and I think it&rsquo;s really resonating with people.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I mean, think about those early Pixel phones.

While other companies are obsessed with making phones as thin as possible, Google&rsquo;s focused on making them as useful and enjoyable as possible. And you know what? It&rsquo;s working. The Pixel Pro and the Pixel Fold are proof that you don&rsquo;t have to sacrifice functionality for style. So what&rsquo;s next for Google&rsquo;s design? I think we&rsquo;ll see them continue to blur the lines between technology and everyday life, creating products that feel less like gadgets and more like natural extensions of ourselves.</p>\n<p>And honestly, I can&rsquo;t wait to see what they come up with next.

And don't even get me started on the Pixel Buds case – it's so satisfying to hold, like a perfectly smooth pebble.\n\n<div class=\"microblog_collection\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/google-materials-and-design-lab-m.jpg\" alt=\"Various colorful and neatly arranged design items and accessories are displayed in a modern showroom setting.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/uploads/2025/google-materials-and-design-lab.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/shot-4-0168-fpo1-m.jpg\" alt=\"Several people collaborate around a table with various fabric swatches, color samples, and design elements, suggesting a creative or design-focused activity.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/uploads/2025/shot-4-0168-fpo1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/image-asset-1.jpeg\" alt=\"A display of colorful gadgets and accessories is arranged on white shelves and a tabletop.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/uploads/2025/image-asset-1.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/image-asset.jpeg\" alt=\"Four people are gathered around a table analyzing photographs or documents in a modern, well-lit workspace.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/uploads/2025/image-asset.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/pxl-20231004-152930931-m.jpg\" alt=\"Several smartwatches with different bands and a pair of wireless earbuds are displayed on a white surface.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/uploads/2025/pxl-20231004-152930931.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/pxl-20231004-152740020-m.jpg\" alt=\"A blue smartwatch, a pair of blue earbuds in a case, two blue pencils, and a small blue notepad are displayed on a light blue surface.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/uploads/2025/pxl-20231004-152740020.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/pxl-20231004-152705281-m.jpg\" alt=\"A display showcases a smartphone and several smartwatches with matching orange bands and accessories on a white surface.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/uploads/2025/pxl-20231004-152705281.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/pxl-20231004-223809586-m.jpg\" alt=\"A display features two smartwatches, a smartphone, and various tech accessories on a white surface.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/uploads/2025/pxl-20231004-223809586.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/google-design-lab-interiors-offices-mountain-view-california-usa-dezeen-236-m.jpg\" alt=\"A variety of tech gadgets and design prototypes are displayed on shelves and a counter.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://blog.michaelbtech.com/uploads/2025/google-design-lab-interiors-offices-mountain-view-california-usa-dezeen-236.jpg\"></div>\n\nBut here's the thing: Google isn't just following trends. While other companies are obsessed with making phones as thin as possible, Google's focused on making them as useful and enjoyable as possible. And you know what? It's working. The Pixel Pro and the Pixel Fold are proof that you don't have to sacrifice functionality for style. So what's next for Google's design? I think we'll see them continue to blur the lines between technology and everyday life, creating products that feel less like gadgets and more like natural extensions of ourselves.\n\nAnd honestly, I can't wait to see what they come up with next. It's clear that Google is committed to creating technology that not only serves a purpose but also sparks joy and feels like a natural extension of our lives. That's a design philosophy I can definitely get behind.\n\n{{< vimeo 366590512 >}}\n",

				"content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>“Experience fast and intelligent help, no matter if you are online or offline ”, “Your data stays private—visible only to you, not even Google can see it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kamila Wojciechowska at @AndroidAuthority gained access to a <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-sense-3531570/?s=15\">pretty hefty @GooglePixel leak</a> and it&rsquo;s everything I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to in a smartphone. Apple level privacy with Google level usefulness. From the sound of everything in the leak, it sounds like Google is looking to bring its version of Apple Intelligence to its Pixel 10, but calling it &ldquo;Pixel Sense&rdquo;. I absolutely love the name. Obviously it&rsquo;ll be powered by Gemini, but with it being completely on-device (🤯) and private, it sounds like Gemini Nano will be at the steering wheel, making all the data processing across all Google apps on Pixel 10 happen swiftly and privately on-device.</p>\n<p>My suspicion is that the driving factor for this is speed, privacy is just the blessing result of on-device processing. A good example of this is Gboard&rsquo;s Assistant Voice typing and Proofread feature. At this point, Google already has a Scrooge McDuck level of user data locked up in an encrypted vault. It&rsquo;s now all about making your data more universally accessible to you. It sounds like the latest evolution of that is making our own personal data even more useful and quickly accessible to us. It sounds awfully similar to what Apple announced at WWDC'24, a whole year ago, that has yet to even be released on the latest iPhone 16 models.

				"content_text": "> “Experience fast and intelligent help, no matter if you are online or offline ”, “Your data stays private—visible only to you, not even Google can see it.”\n\nKamila Wojciechowska at @AndroidAuthority gained access to a [pretty hefty @GooglePixel leak](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-sense-3531570/?s=15) and it's everything I've been looking forward to in a smartphone. Apple level privacy with Google level usefulness. From the sound of everything in the leak, it sounds like Google is looking to bring its version of Apple Intelligence to its Pixel 10, but calling it \"Pixel Sense\". I absolutely love the name. Obviously it'll be powered by Gemini, but with it being completely on-device (🤯) and private, it sounds like Gemini Nano will be at the steering wheel, making all the data processing across all Google apps on Pixel 10 happen swiftly and privately on-device.\n\nMy suspicion is that the driving factor for this is speed, privacy is just the blessing result of on-device processing. A good example of this is Gboard's Assistant Voice typing and Proofread feature. At this point, Google already has a Scrooge McDuck level of user data locked up in an encrypted vault. It's now all about making your data more universally accessible to you. It sounds like the latest evolution of that is making our own personal data even more useful and quickly accessible to us. It sounds awfully similar to what Apple announced at WWDC'24, a whole year ago, that has yet to even be released on the latest iPhone 16 models. And rumor has it, by Mark Gurman, that the [iPhone won't even see that until 2027. ](https://www.theverge.com/news/622465/siris-real-ai-upgrade-could-still-be-years-away). Also something to consider is that this is something OpenAI won't be able to do anytime soon until they make their own hardware. Unless Apple, Samsung, or any other hardware makers decide to give OpenAI's ChatGPT access to secure enclaves.  \n",

They make the best parts of it available on other platforms, greatly reducing the perceived value of their own hardware. Why switch to a Pixel when almost all of Google’s apps are available on iOS? Why switch to an Apple TV box when the TV app and iTunes Store are built into your “smart” TV?&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve understood for as long as owning a Google Nexus. I&rsquo;ve always wondered how Google approaches hardware development, especially given their lack of the kind of exclusive ecosystem that Apple cultivates. Even other Android OEMs have some unique features.  That just wasn&rsquo;t Google&rsquo;s culture in building its products. Google is synonymous with software, encompassing products like Search, YouTube, Gmail, and Android. We&rsquo;re nearing the 10th generation of the Google Pixel. <a href=\"https://x.com/lockheimer/status/779757830203068416\">Hiroshi Lockheimer&rsquo;s prediction</a> that &ldquo;eight years from now we&rsquo;ll be talking about Oct 4, 2016&rdquo; has already passed. October 4th, the release date of the original Google Pixel, was what many, including myself, assumed he was referencing. However, it&rsquo;s now 2025, nearly ten years later, and Google&rsquo;s Pixel has only achieved a 4% market share, according to <a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/post-insight-us-smartphone-sellin-down-4-yoy-in-q3-as-demand-remains-muted/\">Counterpoint Research</a>.

				"content_text": "[John Gruber made a really good analogy on how Google treats Pixel, their smartphone and Tablet hardware products. ](https://daringfireball.net/2023/10/googles_pixel_8_event#fn1-2023-10-05)\n\n> \"Google treats its entire Pixel portfolio like Apple treats Apple TV hardware. They make the best parts of it available on other platforms, greatly reducing the perceived value of their own hardware. Why switch to a Pixel when almost all of Google’s apps are available on iOS? Why switch to an Apple TV box when the TV app and iTunes Store are built into your “smart” TV?\"\n\nThis is something I've understood for as long as owning a Google Nexus. I've always wondered how Google approaches hardware development, especially given their lack of the kind of exclusive ecosystem that Apple cultivates. Even other Android OEMs have some unique features.  That just wasn't Google's culture in building its products. Google is synonymous with software, encompassing products like Search, YouTube, Gmail, and Android. We're nearing the 10th generation of the Google Pixel. [Hiroshi Lockheimer's prediction](https://x.com/lockheimer/status/779757830203068416) that \"eight years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016\" has already passed. October 4th, the release date of the original Google Pixel, was what many, including myself, assumed he was referencing. However, it's now 2025, nearly ten years later, and Google's Pixel has only achieved a 4% market share, according to [Counterpoint Research](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/post-insight-us-smartphone-sellin-down-4-yoy-in-q3-as-demand-remains-muted/). However, it still feels like gaining market share in their hardware isn't Google's main goal. News broke from 9to5Mac analyst Aaron Perris that [Google's Gemini AI is coming to iOS](https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1893058313316671627) next to Siri in a future update. Echoing Gruber's analogy, this demonstrates Google making its key Pixel features available on other platforms. \n\nI think Google needs to better articulate the value proposition of the Pixel to its existing customers, let alone attract new customers in carrier stores.  Perhaps a renewed focus on hardware exclusivity, or a clearer articulation of Pixel-specific benefits, is needed.\n",

My experience with iPhones (6, 6s, X, Xs, and 12) has further broadened my perspective. However, it&rsquo;s the budget Android segment, a significant portion of global smartphone sales, that truly captivates me. The Pixel 8a, initially released at $499 but now available for $300-$400 a year later, offers amazing value: a device promising six more years of feature updates.</p>\n<p>The Pixel 8a immediately feels comfortable in hand. It&rsquo;s easy to handle, not prone to slipping, and not overly heavy or clunky. While it lacks the premium feel of my Pixel 9 Pro, it possesses a reassuring solidity. It&rsquo;s like a familiar, comforting tool. The matte back feels surprisingly sturdy, almost like a warm porcelain countertop. The buttons offer a satisfying &ldquo;click,&rdquo; though they betray the phone&rsquo;s budget origins slightly, lacking the springy resistance of a higher-end device. Even after a year of use, the click persists. Crucially, one-handed use is a breeze, even for my (slightly above average) sized hands; reaching all four corners of the screen is effortless. It&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;mini&rdquo; phone, but it disappears comfortably into a back pocket, sometimes even flipping around due to its manageable size.</p>\n<p>The feel of a phone is paramount, as smartphones are deeply personal devices that perform a multitude of general and specialized tasks throughout our day. They need to feel approachable, relatable, and human – an extension of ourselves, not an interruption. The Pixel 8a achieves this beautifully, particularly with its matte finish and flat display. There&rsquo;s no awkwardness in holding it; the curvature simply settles into your hand. Unlike some flagship phones that scream &ldquo;luxury item,&rdquo; the 8a feels like a tool – one you appreciate more when you consciously focus on its thoughtful design.</p>\n<p>I particularly appreciate the rounded edges, reminiscent of a perfectly smooth doorknob. The camera bar, while subtle, is a minor point of contention. It creates a slight disruption, particularly when the phone is in a case (even official Google cases), unlike the more integrated camera module of the Pixel 9 Pro. But the color options – especially the Bay and Aloe (though my wife prefers the Porcelain of our review unit) – are absolutely delightful. My main design quibble is the bezels. While not overly large, they are noticeable. I prefer a more minimalist approach, though I understand the need for some bezel.</p>\n<p>The Pixel &ldquo;a&rdquo; series, following the pattern of the 3a after the 3, the 4a after the 4, and so on, continues with the 8a. It borrows heavily from the Pixel 8, with some compromises in camera hardware, display, and (in previous years) wireless charging. However, the line between the &ldquo;a&rdquo; series and the mainline Pixels is blurring, especially with price fluctuations. The 8a&rsquo;s $499 launch price often overlaps with discounted Pixel 8 prices, sometimes making the 8a seem redundant.  The Pixel 8a is, at its core, a budget-friendly Pixel 8. It retains the flagship-level software experience – the AI smarts, the Google Photos magic – but packages it in more affordable hardware.</p>\n<p>In real-world use, the differences between the 8a, the 8, and even my 9 Pro are subtle but noticeable. Performance-wise, both share the Tensor G3 chip, so general usage feels snappy. However, the reduced RAM in the 8a becomes noticeable during processing-intensive tasks like Magic Editor edits, which take slightly longer. The camera compromises are most apparent in ultrawide (.5x) shots, where the 8a&rsquo;s limitations become clear. While not a &ldquo;camera hero,&rdquo; Google&rsquo;s AI processing delivers surprisingly good results, even compared to the 9 Pro&rsquo;s wide-angle lens.</p>\n<p>The display is excellent for its price. While it struggles in direct sunlight, it&rsquo;s bright enough for most conditions. And the 120Hz refresh rate is a welcome addition, making the transition from my 9 Pro far less jarring than it could have been. Battery life is adequate. I found myself reaching for a charger sooner than usual, though my use of Pixel Stands mitigates this. The &ldquo;Limit to 80%&rdquo; battery optimization feature is a welcome addition for long-term battery health.</p>\n<p>The under-display fingerprint sensor is fast and reliable. While not as instantaneous as the ultrasonic sensor on the 9 Pro, it&rsquo;s perfectly adequate for everyday use. And the software? This is where the 8a truly shines. A year after its release, Pixel Feature Drops continue to enhance the experience, bringing features typically reserved for the premium Pro models. With seven years of software support guaranteed, the 8a is a long-term investment.</p>\n<p>The 8a comes in 128GB and 256GB storage options. I chose the 128GB version, relying on my 2TB Google One cloud storage and Google Photos. The display size is a sweet spot for me. It&rsquo;s not too small to be considered &ldquo;mini,&rdquo; nor so large that I need my Pixel Tablet. It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket. My wife, coming from an iPhone 13 Mini, finds it a significant upgrade in size and usability. The size and design make taking photos and videos easy. It&rsquo;s simple to pull the phone out of a pocket. However, the bezels, while not a major issue overall, become slightly distracting when composing shots with specific framing in mind.\nThe 8a&rsquo;s pricing is a bit confusing. Its $499 launch price often overlapped with discounted Pixel 8 prices, making the choice less clear. This underscores the need for potential buyers to compare prices and features between the 8a and the 8 (or consider waiting for the 9a). I helped my parents purchase their Pixel 8a phones, and they absolutely love them, capturing surprisingly good photos (even of a heron on their deck!) without needing to be photography experts or spend a fortune. This exemplifies the 8a&rsquo;s target audience: users who appreciate a good camera and a smooth Android experience without breaking the bank.</p>\n<p>The main trade-offs with the 8a compared to the Pixel 8 are the camera sensor size (affecting light capture and detail), the RAM (impacting AI processing speed), and the more visible bezels. If these aren&rsquo;t deal-breakers, and the Pixel 8 isn&rsquo;t cheaper, the 8a is an excellent choice. The ideal Pixel 8a user wants a smooth, reliable Android experience with a great camera for the price, and values long-term software support.

Even a year later, the software remains snappy, demonstrating Google&rsquo;s commitment to the &ldquo;a&rdquo; series. I&rsquo;m confident the Pixel 8a will age well, thanks to Google&rsquo;s seven-year update commitment and features like Battery Optimization.

This represents a significant jump from the approximately 1% share it held in 2023.\n\nThis move into physical retail could be a game-changer for Google in India, allowing the company to showcase its products directly to consumers and build a stronger brand presence. It remains to be seen whether Google can replicate the success of Apple's retail strategy, but the company's investment in India suggests it is serious about making a mark in this rapidly growing market.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/1c7a00e910.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n",

Mostly Android 9+ devices. And there&rsquo;s been a lot of misinformation about it so I figured I&rsquo;d provide more <strong>correct</strong> information on the web about it. In short, it&rsquo;s like having a bouncer for your phone. <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/5-new-protections-on-google-messages.html\">You can read the entire blog post from Google about it on their Security Blog</a>, but I&rsquo;ll try to explain in less detail. In short, Google lists the following new protections:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Enhances detection protects you from package delivery and job scams.</li>\n<li>Intelligent warnings alert you about potentially dangerous links.</li>\n<li>Controls to turn off messages from unknown international senders.</li>\n<li>Sensitive Content Warnings give you control over seeing and sending images that may contain nudity.</li>\n<li>More confirmation about who you&rsquo;re messaging.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So this bouncer uses AI to spot shady stuff like spam, scams, malware, and even those NSFW pics (yikes!) in your messages and apps. The best part? It does all this without snitching to Google or anyone else. Think of it like a super-smart security guard who can spot trouble without calling the cops. By not snitching to Google or anyone else or calling the cops, it&rsquo;s not sending your information to anyone. <strong>ANYONE</strong>.</p>\n<p>Now, some people have been mistakenly thinking, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this like that client-side scanning thing Apple tried to pull?&rdquo; Nah, not even close.

It keeps everything on your phone and doesn&rsquo;t share anything with anyone. It&rsquo;s more like Apple&rsquo;s Communication Safety feature in iMessage, which warns kids about sensitive content but doesn&rsquo;t share anything with Apple.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, like I said, <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/mx.twitch/post/DGLwlHjT8oP?xmt=AQGzUsce7b-QIBKJFL80bCxQmwUvY_uU2zn6GZF2iI_mqw\">there&rsquo;s been some misinformation</a> floating around about SafetyCore, with some folks calling it &ldquo;spyware.&rdquo;  But that&rsquo;s simply not true. As the privacy-focused folks at <a href=\"https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1888280836426084502?mx=2\">GrapheneOS put it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The app doesn&rsquo;t provide client-side scanning used to report things to Google or anyone else. It provides on-device machine learning models usable by applications to classify content as being spam, scams, malware, etc. This allows apps to check content locally without sharing it with a service and mark it with warnings for users.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The GrapheneOS team are experts in this field, and they clearly state that <strong>SafetyCore doesn&rsquo;t share your data</strong>.  So, you can rest assured that your privacy is protected.</p>\n<p>The GrapheneOS team does wish Google would make the whole thing open source, which would increase transparency and trust. I agree  with this too, but here&rsquo;s the thing: apps have been able to do this AI security stuff for a while now, but they usually send your data to their servers. <strong>SafetyCore keeps everything local, which is a big win for privacy.</strong></p>\n<p>Okay, so circling back to that <em>&ldquo;not snitching to the cops&rdquo;</em> part: SafetyCore isn&rsquo;t about reporting illegal stuff to the authorities.

The TL;DR is <strong>Google&rsquo;s Android System SafetyCore seems like a pretty sweet deal for boosting your phone&rsquo;s security and privacy</strong>.

				"content_html": "<p>Google is doing the right thing by bringing all of the Android development features from phones to Android XR, and one big question developers had was about using the pass-through cameras on Android XR headsets. It appears they are, based on an recent email exchange that a VR developer, <a href=\"https://skarredghost.com/2025/02/07/android-xr-camera-access-2/#google_vignette\">Skarred Ghost</a> had with a Google spokesperson, confirming  that Android XR developers will have access to camera functionalities.

It reminds me of something Pharrell Williams said at the recent AI Summit in Paris:</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-internet-in-the-90speople-were-genuinely-worried\">&ldquo;The internet in the &rsquo;90s&hellip;people were genuinely worried.&rdquo;</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/359a186e66.jpg\" alt=\"Three people are seated on stage, engaged in a panel discussion, with one person speaking into a microphone.\"></p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s right. By doing a little research and seeing how people viewed the internet back then, I&rsquo;ve gotten a good understanding of just how worried many were. Some marveled at the instant access to information, while others worried about its impact. It&rsquo;s funny, isn&rsquo;t it? Fast forward to today, and it&rsquo;s hard to imagine life without it. We&rsquo;re at a similar inflection point with AI, and honestly, I think that&rsquo;s what makes events like the AI Summit in Paris so important. They bring together people from all over the world—researchers, tech companies, everyday consumers—and spark a global conversation about what AI can achieve.  This isn&rsquo;t about robots taking over; it&rsquo;s about AI becoming a powerful partner, accelerating human ingenuity and ushering in a new era of innovation. And this vision was echoed by Sundar Pichai, who emphasized the incredible potential of AI to address some of humanity&rsquo;s greatest challenges.</p>\n<p>I think one of the biggest hurdles AI faces is perception. We&rsquo;ve all seen the movies—the iRobot antagonist, the Matrix scenarios—and it&rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of thinking AI is inherently malicious, destined to take our jobs and turn us into batteries. But like most things in life, there&rsquo;s a good side to this. Just like any tool, AI can be used for good or bad. And at the AI Summit, we saw so many examples of the <strong>good</strong> it can do.</p>\n<p>AI isn&rsquo;t a sudden invention; it&rsquo;s the next logical step in our technological evolution. Just as we moved from basic computing to the internet, and then to mobile, AI is now poised to become ubiquitous. Imagine a &ldquo;universal AI assistant&rdquo; – seamlessly integrated into your Android phone, your Google Workspace, your smart home, and beyond. This is the vision behind concepts like &ldquo;Project Astra&rdquo;: AI that understands context, anticipates needs, and assists you across all aspects of your life. It&rsquo;s not just a feature; it&rsquo;s a fundamental shift in how we interact with technology.</p>\n<p>AI&rsquo;s real magic? It&rsquo;s all about collaboration. And science is where we&rsquo;re seeing some truly mind-blowing breakthroughs. Consider AlphaFold, a super-smart AI from DeepMind, that can predict how proteins are shaped with incredible accuracy. Proteins are like the building blocks of life, and knowing their shape is key to understanding diseases and developing new treatments. Researchers estimate that AlphaFold has saved years of research time, not just days or weeks. Over a million researchers worldwide have used AlphaFold, accessing over 200 million protein structure predictions, accelerating research in areas from drug discovery to combating antibiotic resistance. Building on this success, Isomorphic Labs is using machine learning to revolutionize drug design, potentially shortening development timelines and creating more effective treatments. And we&rsquo;re just scratching the surface. The next big thing on the horizon? It&rsquo;s called Quantum Computing. Imagine regular computers as light bulbs—they can be on or off. Quantum computers are more like lasers—they can be on, off, <strong>and</strong> a whole bunch of other states in between. This gives them the potential to solve problems that are impossible for today&rsquo;s computers. Breakthroughs like Google&rsquo;s Willow quantum chip, with its improved coherence and control, promise to unlock computational power previously unimaginable. Collaborative efforts, like those with Servier in France, are pushing the boundaries of what&rsquo;s possible, exploring how quantum AI can solve complex problems in materials science, chemistry, and beyond.</p>\n<p>AI isn&rsquo;t just changing science; it&rsquo;s changing the world around us, one innovation at a time. Waymo has already logged millions of passenger trips, proving that self-driving cars aren&rsquo;t just a futuristic dream—they&rsquo;re a present-day reality. This isn&rsquo;t just about convenience; it&rsquo;s about increasing road safety and accessibility. With 110 new languages added, Google Translate is tearing down communication barriers and building bridges of understanding across cultures. Imagine the impact on education, business, and personal connections. AI is also revolutionizing healthcare, from assisting in cancer research to improving diabetic retinopathy screening (which helps doctors detect eye diseases caused by diabetes). Partnerships like the one with Institute Curry, and work in India and Thailand, are leading to earlier diagnoses, more personalized treatments, and ultimately, better patient outcomes. AI-powered flood forecasts now cover 80 countries, and wildfire mapping provides crucial real-time information, helping communities prepare for and respond to natural disasters. These tools are saving lives and protecting livelihoods.  I was particularly struck by the stories shared at the AI Summit, like the one about Max using Gemini to learn about his son&rsquo;s rare disease.

With smart TVs everywhere, YouTube&rsquo;s a major player in our living rooms, going head-to-head with traditional TV. This changes everything, from ads and content to how we even define &ldquo;television.&rdquo; And speaking of the living room, let’s not forget YouTube Primetime!

The potential is huge, and it could totally change how we make and watch videos.\nBeyond the headlines, the blog post has some cool stats. YouTube&rsquo;s dominance in podcasts, for example, is surprising but also makes sense.  More podcast integration could be a game-changer for creators and listeners. And with more people watching YouTube on their TVs, YouTube&rsquo;s focus on connected TVs and better streaming is a smart move.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, YouTube&rsquo;s 2025 vision is ambitious and optimistic.  They&rsquo;re not just keeping up with change; they&rsquo;re trying to lead the way. By betting on creators, tech, and their role as a cultural hub, YouTube&rsquo;s setting itself up for a big future in media and entertainment.  It&rsquo;s going to be fun to watch what happens next. And hey, even the comments section is a whole lot better than it used to be, right?  (Okay, maybe not always.)</p>\n",

The potential is huge, and it could totally change how we make and watch videos.\nBeyond the headlines, the blog post has some cool stats. YouTube's dominance in podcasts, for example, is surprising but also makes sense.  More podcast integration could be a game-changer for creators and listeners. And with more people watching YouTube on their TVs, YouTube's focus on connected TVs and better streaming is a smart move.\n\nLooking ahead, YouTube's 2025 vision is ambitious and optimistic.  They're not just keeping up with change; they're trying to lead the way. By betting on creators, tech, and their role as a cultural hub, YouTube's setting itself up for a big future in media and entertainment.  It's going to be fun to watch what happens next. And hey, even the comments section is a whole lot better than it used to be, right?  (Okay, maybe not always.)\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I was recently reminded of the perception that people with Android phones are seen as stubborn and non-conforming when someone asked me why I don&rsquo;t have an iPhone. This happened during an in-person conversation when I used my Pixel to reply to a text. The person simply asked why I didn&rsquo;t have an iPhone, and I replied that I prefer the phone I have. It seemed so unfamiliar to them. This experience echoed as I watched the Lakers game, noticing the sea of iPhones in the stands. It made me think about how the &ldquo;blue bubble&rdquo; of iMessage has become such a status symbol, even though I&rsquo;ve found my Android integrates perfectly with all the services I use daily.</p>\n<p>I remember when I first switched to Android because of its customization options. I love being able to personalize my home screen with widgets and icon packs that reflect my style. It&rsquo;s not about being different; it&rsquo;s about having a phone that truly feels like mine. And the variety! There are so many different Android phones available, each with its own strengths. I chose my Pixel because of its camera and its smooth performance, but someone else might prefer a phone with a longer battery life or a larger screen. The point is, there&rsquo;s an Android phone out there for everyone.</p>\n<p>But in the past five years, my preference for Pixel has solidified even further because of its seamless integration with cutting-edge AI. Platforms like Gemini and Perplexity, which are revolutionizing how we interact with technology, work so much better within the Android ecosystem, especially on Pixel devices. It&rsquo;s not just about the customization anymore; it&rsquo;s about having access to these powerful tools that enhance productivity and provide a truly intelligent mobile experience. This level of AI integration is a game-changer, and it&rsquo;s something I wouldn&rsquo;t want to sacrifice.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, I almost switched to an iPhone myself this year. When I saw the announcements at WWDC and Apple unveiled Apple Intelligence, I was intrigued. I was almost ready to jump ship when the iPhone 16 came out. However, after the initial excitement subsided, I realized that Apple Intelligence wasn&rsquo;t quite the finished product it was presented as. It seemed like Apple was, and frankly still is, quite behind the competition in the AI space.

It successfully captured a human and relatable tone, demonstrating Gemini&rsquo;s practical applications on the Pixel.  The subtle approach to Pixel promotion aligns with Android&rsquo;s focus on user choice (within its own ecosystem).  While the ad masterfully evoked human emotion, the sales message felt slightly less developed, which kept it from an &lsquo;A&rsquo; grade.  Strategically, Google may have prioritized associating human emotion with the brand over direct sales.  Perhaps a relatable celebrity could have further amplified this emotional connection.

It successfully captured a human and relatable tone, demonstrating Gemini's practical applications on the Pixel.  The subtle approach to Pixel promotion aligns with Android's focus on user choice (within its own ecosystem).  While the ad masterfully evoked human emotion, the sales message felt slightly less developed, which kept it from an 'A' grade.  Strategically, Google may have prioritized associating human emotion with the brand over direct sales.  Perhaps a relatable celebrity could have further amplified this emotional connection.  Regardless, I found it highly enjoyable. \r\n\r\nNow go rewatch [Kendrick Lamar's halftime performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDorKy-13ak). \r\n",

Finding these relics reminds us of how far Android has come, and how deeply rooted its passionate fan base is. \n\nTo all ex-Google, veteran Google employees or long-standing Android fans, if you have any vintage Android treasures hiding in your cupboards, please share more of them!\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/72af1a2095.jpg\" width=\"337\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/b2a2121948.jpg\" width=\"430\" height=\"430\" alt=\"\">\n",

When you wake up every day and realize that you are an individual, you have to carry that authentic nature and allow yourself to say, &ldquo;This is who I am. This is how people are going to see me and respect me.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s going to inspire people to have truth. When everyone is authentic, what comes out of that is true love.

Products can be announced with shiny, inspiring keynotes promising to \"make the world a better place,\" but they also have a darker side. **This is Google's dark side today, and I strongly disapprove of it.** This decision could lead to the development of AI-powered weapons systems, increased surveillance, and other ethically problematic applications.\n\n[Google’s “AI Principles” in 2018](https://blog.google/technology/ai/ai-principles/)\n\n[Google’s “AI Principles” in 2025](https://blog.google/technology/ai/responsible-ai-2024-report-ongoing-work/)\n\n**Proverbs 16:25**: _\"There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death.\"_\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/gemini-generated-image-g3wbz9g3wbz9g3wb.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n",

This is bidirectional with the ability to transfer a song from the Pixel Tablet to your Pixel phone also available.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Officially, Google is using a “range of technologies to determine the proximity and presence of devices as part of multi-device experiences, which includes UWB.” Its Cross device SDK was announced in 2022 and consists of three layers:</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><em>“The first layer recognizes what devices are physically close by, with wireless technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi, and ultra-wideband (UWB).”</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><em>“The second layer is nearby device discovery and context-aware capabilities that identify which device you may want to use based on your current activity.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><em>“Finally, the third layer understands and adjusts actions based on how you interact with your devices with cross-device intelligence.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Google went as far to explain that &ldquo;Tap to Cast&rdquo; is available without any additional work if developers integrate <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/android_sender/output_switcher\">Output Switcher (2.0) on Android 14</a>. Right now, it&rsquo;s only available with YouTube Music and Spotify with UWB enabled Pixel devices like my Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel Tablet.

I heard about the feature when it was announced, but I never knew when it would reach my devices. It was a nice surprise. Especially when it was a happenstance instead of, like I used to, spam the update button to get the latest features. I need to take on that practice more. See the feature announced and go about my day, not angrily spam the \"update\" button and shake my fist at the clouds like a mad man, trying to force the feature to my devices. \r\n\r\nI digress. Abner at [9to5Google explained it best](https://9to5google.com/2024/01/09/pixel-tablet-tap-to-cast/) back in January, 2024: \r\n\r\n>_When listening with YouTube Music or Spotify, bringing your Pixel 6 Pro, 7 Pro, 8 Pro, or Fold – which all have UWB (Ultra-Wideband) – near a docked Pixel Tablet will seamlessly move what’s playing between devices. This is bidirectional with the ability to transfer a song from the Pixel Tablet to your Pixel phone also available._\r\n\r\n> _Officially, Google is using a “range of technologies to determine the proximity and presence of devices as part of multi-device experiences, which includes UWB.” Its Cross device SDK was announced in 2022 and consists of three layers:_\r\n\r\n> * _“The first layer recognizes what devices are physically close by, with wireless technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi, and ultra-wideband (UWB).”_\r\n\r\n> * _“The second layer is nearby device discovery and context-aware capabilities that identify which device you may want to use based on your current activity.”_\r\n\r\n> * _“Finally, the third layer understands and adjusts actions based on how you interact with your devices with cross-device intelligence.”_\r\n\r\nGoogle went as far to explain that \"Tap to Cast\" is available without any additional work if developers integrate [Output Switcher (2.0) on Android 14](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/android_sender/output_switcher). Right now, it's only available with YouTube Music and Spotify with UWB enabled Pixel devices like my Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel Tablet. It's nice to know that this isn't an exclusive Pixel feature so more hardware and apps could be supported in the future! \r\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/pxl-20250130-230659756-exported-5900-1.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n",

				"title": "Android XR: The Dawn of a New Era in Headset Innovation?",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>After watching Marques Brownlee's exclusive look at the Samsung prototype running Android XR, I'm buzzing with a level of excitement I haven't felt for a new tech platform in years. While Apple's visionOS and Meta's HorizonOS are intriguing, Android XR feels different. It carries the same vibrant energy as the early days of Android, promising a wave of innovation and diverse hardware experiences that could truly revolutionize the XR space.</p><p>Think back to the launch of Android. Every time Google's mobile OS enters a new form factor – smartphones, tablets, smartwatches – it ignites a spark. Suddenly, a flurry of manufacturers, both established giants and nimble startups, emerge with unique hardware interpretations. We see a burst of creativity, pushing the boundaries of design and functionality. This is precisely what Android XR promises for headsets.</p><p>The open nature of Android fosters a healthy ecosystem. It's not just one company dictating the entire experience, limiting choices and stifling innovation. Instead, Android XR empowers hardware makers to focus on what they do best: crafting amazing devices. Companies like Sony, XReal, and countless others we haven't even heard of yet will have access to a robust software foundation, allowing them to differentiate themselves through innovative hardware designs and specialized features. This echoes the dynamism we've seen in the Android smartphone market, and it's precisely what the XR space needs.</p><p>But the excitement doesn't stop at the open ecosystem. What truly blew me away was the sheer polish and sophistication of the Android XR software, even in its prototype stage. Remember those early \"Nexus\" devices, the developer previews that often left a lot to be desired? Think back to the barebones experience of the first Nexus phones or the initial Android Wear watches like the LG G Watch. Android XR is a completely different beast. It's clear that Google and Samsung have poured significant effort into crafting a premium software experience from the get-go.</p><p>The integration of AI, exemplified by the Gemini assistant, is truly mind-blowing. Seeing how effortlessly Gemini can be used for navigation, app interaction, and even real-time environmental information feels like stepping into the realm of science fiction – in the best possible way. The \"circle to search\" feature, similar to Google Lens, adds another layer of intuitive interaction. It feels like we're witnessing the birth of a truly intelligent and immersive computing platform.</p><p>This whole experience resonates deeply with me. As I've been reading Chet Haase's \"Androids: The Team that Built the Android Operating System,\" the collaboration between Samsung and Google on Android XR feels like a modern-day parallel to the \"mixing bowl\" of engineering talent that birthed the original Android. Just like the engineers from Danger, Be/PalmSource, and WebTV/Microsoft came together to create something magical, the partnership between Samsung and Google has the potential to shape the future of XR.</p><p>I'm keeping my expectations in check for now, but the potential of Android XR is undeniable. More than just one company selling its ecosystem and controlling every aspect of the experience, Android XR represents a fundamental shift. It's a platform that fosters open innovation, empowers hardware makers, and promises a diverse range of devices and experiences. It's the dawn of a new era in headset technology, and I, for one, am incredibly excited to see what the future holds.</p>\n",

				"title": "I Almost Switched to iPhone, But Then Gemini Happened…",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Google just announced quite a few updates to Gemini and is partnering with Samsung to bring these features at scale with the Galaxy S25. And, to no surprise, it's <a href=\"https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/articles/gemini-live-updates/\">rolling out to Pixel 9 series</a> and soon to older Pixel devices such as the Pixel 6.</p><p>One thing I want to point out, though, is how, just 7 months ago, I was considering switching to an iPhone because of Apple Intelligence. You see, when Apple performed their tech infomercial at WWDC, showcasing Apple Intelligence, I was smitten. On cloud nine, envisioning two things: 1. There's no way Android would be able to replicate Apple's AI cohesiveness across the entire mobile OS and 2. Me walking into my carrier's retail store to purchase the latest iPhone 16 that would come with all of the Apple Intelligence features that was announced at WWDC. Wild what can change in 7 months. </p><p>During that 7 months, news got out that not only is the iPhone 16 not getting all of those Apple Intelligence features on day one, but it'll be a whole six to twelve months before all of those features will be available. Maybe I missed that part of the WWDC infomercial, but <a href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/why-i-find-apple-intelligence-underwhelming/#:~:text=All%20the%20Features%20Aren%E2%80%99t%20Even%20Out%20Yet\">I'm not alone in that brief misunderstanding</a>.</p><p>But then, the tides turned. Google swooped in with Gemini, and suddenly the AI landscape shifted dramatically. Fast-forwarding to today, just about everything that I was excited about in Apple Intelligence that still isn't out, not even on the latest iPhone, is currently available on Android with Gemini, specifically Pixel 9 Pro. One of the highlighting features is multi-extensions — the ability to prompt Gemini to do multiple things simultaneously. </p><p>For example, and this just happened a few hours ago, I received an updated note about a wedding my wife, Fatima, and I are going to this Saturday, confirming the location of where the reception is going to be held and what time. It was a pretty lengthy note that would've taken me multiple swipes back and forth between the Messages app, the wedding note, copying back and forth and vice versa to relay the message to my wife. Instead, all I did was prompt Gemini with the wedding note in its entirety and vocally told Gemini, \"Summarize this wedding note, send it to my wife, letting her know that I received this from our friends, and add the reception on my calendar.\" And, in one swoop, it did all three of those things. Summarized the wedding note, created a text to Fatima that prompted me to confirm with a simple, \"Yes\", and added the reception event with the location and correct time on my Google Calendar. Truly a marvelous experience.</p><p>To really grasp how seamlessly this all works, take a look at this…</p><div class=\"native-video-embed\" data-component-name=\"VideoPlaceholder\" data-attrs=\"{\"mediaUploadId\":\"416218c7-4d72-488c-ab49-1ac2b7eb9b5d\",\"duration\":null}\"></div><p></p><p>There are quite a few other features that Google announced during Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event, but this one truly confirmed to me that I made the right decision sticking with my Google Pixel and not getting an iPhone this year. Maybe Apple can magically pull a MacBook Air out of a dossier (hope you get that reference) and change my mind. Probably not.</p>\n",

At least, that's what my mom exclaimed when she called me the other day. Yes, <em>called</em> me. On the actual phone. Seems the latest Facebook shenanigans have finally pushed her to the edge. \"Is there an alternative?\" she asked, her voice laced with a mix of frustration and hope. And, for a moment, I was stumped. The truth is, there isn't an easy answer, especially for someone not steeped in the world of tech. My mind immediately went to the Fediverse, but explaining that to my mom—who'd never even heard the term before—felt like opening a Pandora's Box of technical jargon. This got me thinking. </p><p>Here I am, a tech enthusiast, once a proud Google+ user, now longing for the simpler days of the early Web 2.0 blogosphere. It's almost like admitting defeat, isn't it? But after being burned twice—<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18290637/google-plus-shutdown-consumer-personal-account-delete\">first by Google+</a>, then by Twitter's dramatic transformation into X—I've come to realize the vital importance of owning my own digital space.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{\"url\":\"[michaelbtech.substack.com/subscribe](https://michaelbtech.substack.com/subscribe?)\",\"text\":\"Subscribe\",\"language\":\"en\"}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Thanks for reading MichaelBTech!

It's a fascinating concept, this Fediverse, but it's not without its challenges. It's still a bit like the Wild West out there, with different communities and protocols, and it can be quite daunting for those who aren't particularly tech-savvy. And that's precisely where the \"burn me once, shame on you...\" feeling comes in. After pouring time and energy into building a presence on Google+, only to see it wither and die, and then experiencing the upheaval of Twitter's metamorphosis into X, I've become hesitant to invest heavily in any single platform. It's like building a house on rented land – you never know when the landlord might decide to change the terms of the lease or even evict you altogether.</p><p>That's why owning a domain, having your own little corner of the web, is more crucial now than ever. It's like owning the land your house is built on. You have control, you have stability, and you're not subject to the whims of some corporate overlord. This whole \"convenience-over-ownership\" trend extends beyond the digital realm, doesn't it? Leasing instead of buying, streaming instead of owning your media… we seem to be losing choice in favor of ease of use. It reminds me of that quote, often (though perhaps erroneously) attributed to Mahatma Gandhi: <em>\"Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.\"</em> Are we trading the freedom to tinker and customize for the perceived safety of the walled garden?</p><p>This even impacts how we view our devices. With Android, I feel like I <em>own</em> it, unlike iOS, where Apple controls everything. This is slowly changing through regulation (link an article here), but it makes you wonder about the long-term effects. A <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90839901/dell-study-gen-z-success-in-digital-world\">Dell study</a> found 37% of Gen Z feel unprepared for the demands of the digital world, and 56% lack digital skills education. Are we raising a generation that can only operate within restrictive ecosystems? A friend recently pointed out how we've drifted from the \"old internet,\" where human-created content and community-run services were the norm. He argues that we've prioritized convenience over ethics, safety, and community. This really hit home. </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/https3a2f2fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2fpublic2fimages2fa13518b8-1.png\" width=\"924\" height=\"837\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"[substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/im...](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png)\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":837,\"width\":924,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":332748,\"alt\":null,\"title\":null,\"type\":\"image/png\",\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":false,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13518b8-1c4d-4087-bca6-8ad2aa3ace7b_924x837.png 1272w, https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/https3a2f2fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2fpublic2fimages2fa13518b8-1.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>My wife and I were discussing how, if you post an Instagram photo directing people to a blog post or article on your own site, they're less likely to click. It's just more convenient to stay within Instagram's walled garden, even if it means missing out on potentially valuable content or different perspectives.</p><p>The Fediverse, with its decentralized nature and emphasis on community, offers a potential solution. By moving to these platforms, we can regain some of the control we've lost and prioritize factors like ethics, safety, and community. Of course, the Fediverse and other decentralized platforms offer a glimmer of hope. They represent a potential future where we're not at the mercy of tech giants. But for now, they remain a bit too complex and fragmented for mass adoption. So, where does this leave us in our quest for a Facebook alternative? Well, the truth is, there's no easy answer. The Fediverse, while promising, is still a bit like the Wild West, and it may not be everyone's cup of tea. But this whole exploration has underscored a crucial point: we can't just passively accept the status quo. We need to be mindful of where we build our digital homes and who controls the land they sit on.</p><p>Whether you decide to dip your toes into the Fediverse, explore other emerging platforms, or simply double down on owning your own domain, the key is to stay informed and take control of your online destiny. Don't let \"Mark Zingaburg\" (or anyone else, for that matter) dictate your digital life. Explore your options, find what works best for you, and remember – the internet is vast and ever-evolving. There's a whole world out there beyond the walled gardens of Facebook and the like.

				"content_text": "<p>The Pixel Fold, Google's ambitious entry into the foldable phone arena, is finally here, and has received <a href=\"https://youtu.be/E76CUtSHMrU?si=uLxJAfpkvghe11Yd\">glowing reviews into its second iteration</a>. But while the hardware is impressive, the foldable market itself remains a niche. Year-over-year growth is sluggish, and consumers seem hesitant to embrace this new form factor. That's why I say this: <strong>Google should pump the brakes on a Pixel 10 Pro Fold in 2025</strong>.</p><p>Yes, you heard me right. Instead of rushing out a new model next year, Google should focus on refining the software experience for the existing Pixel Fold. With a promised 7 years of updates, there's ample opportunity to polish the Fold's software, optimize apps for the unique form factor, and truly deliver on the promise of foldable productivity and entertainment.</p><p>This isn't about abandoning the Fold. It's about strategic timing. As <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-roadmap-2023-3259454/\">Android Authority reported last year</a>:</p><p><em>\"Pushing into 2025, our source says Google is looking at several choices for its Pixel roadmap. The success or failure of its 2023 and 2024 plans will influence this decision... Finally, the fate of any Pixel Fold successors in 2025 is still dependent on its market reception.\"</em></p><p>Google has options. A \"wait-and-see\" approach allows them to assess the market, perfect the Fold's software, and deliver a truly compelling successor when the time is right. Perhaps a Pixel 11 Pro Fold in 2026, packed with meaningful advancements and responding to clear consumer demand, would be a more prudent move.</p><p>Now, I know what you're thinking: Won't this signal a lack of commitment to the foldable market? Not if Google plays its cards right. They need to be transparent, explaining their strategy and emphasizing their long-term vision for the Pixel Fold. This isn't a retreat; it's a calculated pause to ensure the next Fold is a home run.</p><p>In the fast-paced world of tech, sometimes slowing down is the smartest way to get ahead. This isn't Google's first foldable, and learning from past experiences is crucial. By giving the Pixel Fold room to breathe, Google can address existing shortcomings, observe the evolving market, and build anticipation for a truly refined successor. Think of it as a chef perfecting a complex recipe; the first attempt might be good, but with careful refinement, the final dish can be truly exceptional.</p>\n",

While I respect Wired&rsquo;s perspective, I disagree with their assessment. I believe the Apple Vision Pro is not a flop, but rather a bold step into the future of mixed reality.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Senior Commerce Editor Julian Chokkattu <!-- raw HTML omitted -->highlights some valid points in his section on the Vision Pro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;I am writing this story on the Apple Vision Pro. I like using it for work more so than entertainment, though I did watch The Weeknd&rsquo;s Open Hearts, an interactive music experience where I was face-to-face with the musician as he was being hauled away in an ambulance through various Inception-esque environments. The visual quality of the film is impressive and it feels immersive to watch—you can see beads of sweat on his face—but there are also moments when the camera changes to sweeping views that look too grainy and pixelated. Apple has released several immersive experiences like this throughout 2024, including a film called Submerged.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Technically, I&rsquo;m using the Vision Pro in Mac Virtual Display mode. I have it wirelessly connected to Apple&rsquo;s new Mac Mini, which brings your computer&rsquo;s screen into a spatial environment, allowing you to place other visionOS apps around it. This mode now gives you options for your Mac&rsquo;s screen size: Standard, Wide, and Ultrawide. I&rsquo;m using the latter and have two browser windows open side by side, plus Slack off to the left, and I&rsquo;m using Apple&rsquo;s Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad. It&rsquo;s great.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s hard not to leave the Vision Pro experience without feeling impressed each time, though I wish this darn battery cable was a little longer. (It slid off my desk while I was wearing the headset, but I thankfully caught the pack before it pulled the wire.) But with Google and Samsung&rsquo;s recent announcement of Android XR, we can expect similar mixed-reality headsets on the way in 2025, and I have a hard time believing most of them will cost as much as the Vision Pro. That&rsquo;s ultimately the main problem with Apple&rsquo;s big 2024 release: It&rsquo;s too far out of reach for almost everyone.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Think back to the original iPhone.

While I respect Wired's perspective, I disagree with their assessment. I believe the Apple Vision Pro is not a flop, but rather a bold step into the future of mixed reality.</p><p>Senior Commerce Editor Julian Chokkattu <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/revisiting-the-three-biggest-flops-of-2024/\">highlights some valid points in his section on the Vision Pro</a>:&nbsp;</p><p><em>\"I am writing this story on the Apple Vision Pro. I like using it for work more so than entertainment, though I did watch The Weeknd's Open Hearts, an interactive music experience where I was face-to-face with the musician as he was being hauled away in an ambulance through various Inception-esque environments. The visual quality of the film is impressive and it feels immersive to watch—you can see beads of sweat on his face—but there are also moments when the camera changes to sweeping views that look too grainy and pixelated. Apple has released several immersive experiences like this throughout 2024, including a film called Submerged.</em></p><p><em>Technically, I'm using the Vision Pro in Mac Virtual Display mode. I have it wirelessly connected to Apple's new Mac Mini, which brings your computer's screen into a spatial environment, allowing you to place other visionOS apps around it. This mode now gives you options for your Mac's screen size: Standard, Wide, and Ultrawide. I'm using the latter and have two browser windows open side by side, plus Slack off to the left, and I'm using Apple's Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad. It's great.</em></p><p><em>It's hard not to leave the Vision Pro experience without feeling impressed each time, though I wish this darn battery cable was a little longer. (It slid off my desk while I was wearing the headset, but I thankfully caught the pack before it pulled the wire.) But with Google and Samsung's recent announcement of Android XR, we can expect similar mixed-reality headsets on the way in 2025, and I have a hard time believing most of them will cost as much as the Vision Pro. That's ultimately the main problem with Apple's big 2024 release: It's too far out of reach for almost everyone.\"</em></p><p>Think back to the original iPhone. It was expensive, had limited functionality compared to today's standards, and yet, it revolutionized the mobile phone industry. The Apple Vision Pro could very well do the same for mixed reality.</p><p>In 10 years, I predict the Apple Vision Pro will still be a niche product, but it will have paved the way for more affordable and accessible Apple headsets. Google and Samsung's <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/android-xr/\">Android XR headsets</a> will likely be strong competitors, offering aggressive pricing and impressive hardware.

				"title": "Pixelbook Go Review: 5 Years Later",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>In the fall of 2019, Google unveiled the Pixelbook Go, a Chromebook aimed at those who wanted a premium, lightweight device without the premium price tag of its predecessor, the Pixelbook. I, however, didn't join the Go bandwagon until two years later, snagging a \"like new\" i5 model with 16GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD for a cool $700 on Swappa. A steal, considering its original $999 MSRP.</p><p>Why a Chromebook in 2021, you ask? Well, dear reader, while my employer generously provides a work laptop, I yearned for a personal machine for those coffee shop jaunts and casual browsing sessions. Something fast, secure, and delightfully simple. Having spent my early career hawking Chromebooks in the aisles of Best Buy, I knew this was the answer.</p><blockquote><p>Speaking of software, one of the biggest draws for me was the maturing of Linux on ChromeOS.</p></blockquote><p>And the Pixelbook Go hasn't disappointed. This isn't your average Chromebook, mind you. The keyboard is a dream – responsive and whisper-quiet, perfect for hammering out emails or tackling a blog post (like this one!). The 1080p webcam is a welcome upgrade from the grainy cameras of yore, making me look presentable in Google Meet calls. Plus, with Google's commitment to ten years of software updates (a recent extension from the initial seven), this machine is built for the long haul.</p>\n<p>But it hasn't been all sunshine and roses. As I began to delve deeper into the world of ChromeOS and its surprisingly robust \"organized workspace\" features, the 13.3-inch screen started to feel a tad cramped. Juggling multiple terminal windows, server configurations, and IDEs for my coding projects became a spatial challenge.</p><p>Speaking of software, one of the biggest draws for me was the maturing of Linux on ChromeOS. No longer a clunky afterthought, it's now a fully integrated environment, allowing me to run my favorite Linux applications alongside my ChromeOS workflow. This, combined with the impressive performance of the i5 processor, makes the Pixelbook Go a surprisingly capable machine for developers and tinkerers. </p><p>My wife, charmed by the Go's portability and sleek design, even decided to join the club. We snagged her the \"Not Pink\" i5 model with 8GB of RAM – more than enough for her needs. </p>\n<p>Looking ahead, I'm curious to see how Google's Chromebook strategy evolves. Rumors are swirling about <a href=\"https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-laptop-development.html\">Android laptops becoming the future</a>. If these rumors bear fruit, I might be tempted to upgrade sooner than my planned 2027 refresh. But for now, the Pixelbook Go remains my trusty companion, a testament to Google's vision of a simple, secure, and (mostly) satisfying computing experience.</p>\n",

While the prospect of an Apple-branded search experience might pique the curiosity of tech enthusiasts, a closer look reveals this is a shrewd decision that aligns perfectly with Apple&rsquo;s core business strategy.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eddy Cue, Apple&rsquo;s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, recently filed a declaration, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reported by Reuters<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, with a U.S. federal court outlining the company&rsquo;s rationale. Cue&rsquo;s arguments are compelling, painting a picture of a project fraught with challenges and misaligned with Apple&rsquo;s strengths, stating the following:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The development of a search engine would cost Apple &ldquo;billions of dollars&rdquo; and &ldquo;take many years,&rdquo; and this would divert investment money and employees away from &ldquo;other growth areas&rdquo; that the company is focused on.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The search business is &ldquo;rapidly evolving&rdquo; due to artificial intelligence, so it would be &ldquo;economically risky&rdquo; for Apple to create a search engine.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In order to create a &ldquo;viable&rdquo; search engine business, Apple would be required to &ldquo;sell targeted advertising,&rdquo; which is &ldquo;not a core business&rdquo; for the company and would go against its &ldquo;longstanding privacy commitments.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple does not have enough &ldquo;specialized professionals&rdquo; and &ldquo;operational infrastructure&rdquo; needed to build and run a successful search engine business.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But here&rsquo;s the kicker: Apple doesn&rsquo;t need to build a search engine. Their lucrative partnership with Google, where Google pays a hefty sum to remain the default search engine on Apple devices, is a cash cow. This arrangement provides Apple with a steady stream of revenue without the headaches and risks associated with building and running their own search engine.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In essence, Apple has recognized that sometimes the best strategy is to double down on your strengths and forge strategic partnerships. By focusing on what they do best – creating beautiful, user-friendly devices and cultivating a loyal customer base – Apple can reap the rewards of the search market without getting their hands dirty.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This decision underscores Apple&rsquo;s pragmatic approach to business.

While the prospect of an Apple-branded search experience might pique the curiosity of tech enthusiasts, a closer look reveals this is a shrewd decision that aligns perfectly with Apple's core business strategy.</p><p>Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, recently filed a declaration, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-seeks-defend-googles-billion-dollar-payments-search-case-2024-12-24/\">reported by Reuters</a>, with a U.S. federal court outlining the company's rationale. Cue's arguments are compelling, painting a picture of a project fraught with challenges and misaligned with Apple's strengths, stating the following:</p><p><em>The development of a search engine would cost Apple \"billions of dollars\" and \"take many years,\" and this would divert investment money and employees away from \"other growth areas\" that the company is focused on.</em></p><p><em>The search business is \"rapidly evolving\" due to artificial intelligence, so it would be \"economically risky\" for Apple to create a search engine.</em></p><p><em>In order to create a \"viable\" search engine business, Apple would be required to \"sell targeted advertising,\" which is \"not a core business\" for the company and would go against its \"longstanding privacy commitments.\"</em></p><p><em>Apple does not have enough \"specialized professionals\" and \"operational infrastructure\" needed to build and run a successful search engine business.</em></p><p>But here's the kicker: Apple doesn't need to build a search engine. Their lucrative partnership with Google, where Google pays a hefty sum to remain the default search engine on Apple devices, is a cash cow. This arrangement provides Apple with a steady stream of revenue without the headaches and risks associated with building and running their own search engine.</p><p>In essence, Apple has recognized that sometimes the best strategy is to double down on your strengths and forge strategic partnerships. By focusing on what they do best – creating beautiful, user-friendly devices and cultivating a loyal customer base – Apple can reap the rewards of the search market without getting their hands dirty.</p><p>This decision underscores Apple's pragmatic approach to business. They understand that not every battle is worth fighting, and sometimes the most profitable path lies in collaboration, not competition. And with Google effectively bankrolling a significant portion of their business, it's a strategy that seems to be paying off handsomely.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>As we stand at the cusp of yet another technological shift, a sense of measured anticipation hangs in the air. The landscape, once dominated by rapid-fire innovation, feels strangely still. The once-revolutionary smartphone, now ubiquitous and indispensable, seems to have plateaued in its evolution. The explosive growth of software breakthroughs like cloud computing and social networks has matured into a steady, albeit less dramatic, upward trajectory.</p><p>This subtle transition period offers a moment for reflection, a chance to ponder the dynamics that drive innovation within the tech titans that shape our digital world. A recent conversation on \"The Diary of a CEO\" with former Google CEO Eric Schmidt offered a particularly insightful lens through which to examine these dynamics, specifically regarding the intricate dance between focus and expansion within large organizations.</p><p>Schmidt's tenure at Google coincided with a period of unprecedented growth and diversification. The company, emboldened by its dominance in search, ventured into a dizzying array of domains. The prevailing belief, as Schmidt articulated, was that Google, with its formidable infrastructure and vast reach, could conquer any market it chose to enter. This ambition, while understandable, presented a fundamental challenge: the tension between pursuing every opportunity and maintaining a laser-like focus on core strengths.</p><p>The rise of YouTube, which ultimately outmaneuvered Google's own video platform, served as a stark reminder of the agility and focused drive that smaller, nimbler startups possess. Large corporations, burdened by their own complexity, often struggle to pivot with the same speed and decisiveness.</p><p>Schmidt reflected on the age-old business school adage of streamlining product lines and focusing on a singular area of expertise. The example of Intel divesting itself of the ARM architecture, a decision that inadvertently sidelined them from the mobile revolution, underscored the potential pitfalls of oversimplification.</p><p>So, how does a company navigate this labyrinthine path between focused execution and expansive vision? Schmidt offered a compelling framework: envision the future. Project forward five years, he suggested, and map out the anticipated landscape. Take AI, for instance. How many players will be in the field? What will be the defining characteristics of the dominant companies? What platforms will reign supreme?</p><p>By meticulously constructing this future scenario, one can then work backward, identifying the strategic decisions and investments necessary to secure a position of strength within that evolving ecosystem. This \"future-back\" approach allows for a nuanced form of focus, one that doesn't blindly adhere to current product lines but instead anticipates and adapts to the inevitable shifts that lie ahead. It's about being selective and strategic in expansion to stay ahead of the curve. This is exactly what Google was doing while Eric Schmidt was there. The company wanted to be at the forefront of AI and was using that exact technique, which has led to Google being a major player in the AI space.</p><p>The tech world is in a perpetual state of flux. The challenge for industry leaders is not simply to react to these changes but to anticipate them, to shape the future rather than be shaped by it. Schmidt's insights remind us that true innovation requires a delicate balance between ambitious vision and strategic focus, guided by a clear-eyed understanding of the road ahead. It requires leaders to ask the right questions today, to secure their place in the tomorrows to come.</p><p>Head over to \"The Diary of a CEO\" and experience this insightful conversation for yourself. You won't be disappointed.</p><div id=\"youtube2-2Zg--ouGl7c\" class=\"youtube-wrap\" data-attrs=\"{\"videoId\":\"2Zg--ouGl7c\",\"startTime\":null,\"endTime\":null}\" data-component-name=\"Youtube2ToDOM\"><div class=\"youtube-inner\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2Zg--ouGl7c?rel=0&autoplay=0&showinfo=0&enablejsapi=0\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowautoplay=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"728\" height=\"409\"></iframe></div></div>\n",

It tells the true story of 855 Black women in the Army Corps who bravely joined the war effort during World War II. Facing a daunting backlog of mail that stretched back three years, these women confronted discrimination and the harsh realities of war-torn Europe.</p><p>Against all odds, they sorted over 17 million pieces of mail, delivering messages of hope and connection to soldiers and families back home. And they did it all ahead of schedule. \"The Six Triple Eight\" is a powerful testament to the strength, resilience, and often-unsung contributions of Black women during wartime. It's a must-watch.</p>\n",

While Google plans to appeal the decision, it&rsquo;s also playing the game by proposing remedies to address the court&rsquo;s concerns.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In essence, the court found that Google&rsquo;s agreements with browser and device makers to feature its search engine as the default option were anti-competitive.

A court recently took issue with the tech giant's search distribution contracts, essentially saying they stifle competition. While Google plans to appeal the decision, it's also playing the game by proposing remedies to address the court's concerns.</p><p>In essence, the court found that Google's agreements with browser and device makers to feature its search engine as the default option were anti-competitive. Google, naturally, disagrees, arguing its dominance stems from building a superior product and making savvy business decisions.</p><p>Now, before you picture Google being carved up like a Thanksgiving turkey, let me tell you about <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/\">their proposed remedies</a>. They're actually quite interesting.</p><h2>The Gist of Google's Proposal</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Browsers get more freedom:</strong> Companies like Apple and Mozilla can still make deals with Google Search, but they'll have more flexibility. They can set different default search engines for different platforms (like iPhones versus iPads) and browsing modes. Plus, they can change their default search provider at least every 12 months.</p></li><li><p><strong>Android gets unbundled:</strong> Device makers will have more flexibility in preloading multiple search engines and Google apps. This means you might see more variety on your Android home screen, and competitors like Microsoft get a fairer shot at placement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Oversight without overreach:</strong> Google proposes a system to ensure compliance with the court's order, but without giving the government excessive control over your online experience.</p></li></ul><h2>My Two Cents</h2><p>Frankly, these seem like reasonable proposals. It's like Google is saying, \"Okay, we hear you, but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater.\" They acknowledge the need for a more level playing field while still protecting their hard-earned innovations.</p><p>The idea of platform-specific search defaults is particularly intriguing. Imagine your iPhone defaulting to DuckDuckGo for privacy, while your iPad sticks with Google for its familiar interface. This kind of flexibility could empower users and foster competition.</p><p>Unbundling search from other Google apps on Android is also a smart move. It addresses a key complaint from competitors while giving users more choice.</p><p>Of course, the devil is in the details. We'll have to see how these proposals play out in practice. But at first glance, Google seems to be striking a balance between addressing antitrust concerns and preserving its ability to innovate.</p><p>While Google's proposals sound good on paper, I'll be watching closely to see how they impact consumers in the real world. Will we truly see more choice and competition in the search market? Or will Google find clever ways to maintain its dominance? Only time will tell.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This blog post reflects my personal opinions and should not be taken as legal or financial advice.</p>\n",

Imagine interacting with your devices and services in a completely natural way, like you're talking to Jarvis from Iron Man. \"Hey Google, make me a reservation at that new fusion restaurant downtown,\" or \"Hey Google, write a blog post about my 2025 tech predictions.\" (Wait a minute...)</p><p>But here's the kicker: Google will finally let you personalize the \"hot word\" that triggers these AI agents. Tired of saying \"Hey Google\"? No problem. Call it Jarvis, Jeeves, Alfred, or whatever your digital heart desires. These AI agents will be so smart and intuitive, it'll feel like you've stepped into the future – and you can customize it to your liking.</p><p>So there you have it, folks. My 2025 tech predictions. What are yours? Share your thoughts in the comments below – let's see&nbsp;</p><p>who has the best foresight!</p>\n",

As a Pixel 9 Pro user myself, I was especially hyped to see Google finally getting some serious recognition.</p><p>Here's the rundown:</p><ul><li><p>&nbsp;<strong>Best Big Phone:</strong> Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra (no surprise there)</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;<strong>Best Small Phone</strong>: iPhone 16 (again, expected)</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;<strong>Best Camera:</strong> iPhone 16 Pro (sigh... Apple still holds this one)</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;<strong>Best Value:</strong> Nothing Phone 2A (good to see some disruptors!)</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;<strong>Best Battery:</strong> Red Magic 10 Pro (gaming phones FTW!)</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;<strong>Best Design: </strong>Huawei Mate Xt (that fold is sleek)</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;<strong>Best Foldable: </strong>Pixel 9 Pro Fold! (YES!)</p></li><li><p><strong>&nbsp;Most Improved:</strong> Pixel 9 Pro Fold! (DOUBLE YES!)</p></li><li><p><strong>&nbsp;Bust of the Year:</strong> Asus Zenphone 11 Ultra (ouch)</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;<strong>MVP Phone of the Year:</strong> Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra (Samsung takes it again)</p></li></ul><p>While I'm a bit bummed the Pixel didn't snag the overall MVP, those Foldable wins are HUGE. I've been rocking the Pixel 9 Pro for months now, and it's the best phone I've ever used. The camera is fantastic (even if not \"the best\"), the battery lasts forever, and the software is smooth as butter. Marques himself uses the 9 Pro XL as his daily driver, which says something.</p><p>If you're looking for a phone that does it all, with a killer foldable option, Google's finally stepped up to the plate. Check out the full video for Marques' in-depth thoughts, but consider this your <strong>TL;DR: Pixel's a contender now, folks.</strong></p><a class=\"image-link image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2LEX5u3oxExBJY1M7YSUp5yH5PCnLOvMLCEaS6Nnz_wWQnbokd4J0c9MsTfpT6SKOQ4cfrOLpznCg_qCVOO181UxoATGPWQ34r1tMZiuJbIXAql5xgHcwkvrCu_Lg9octvsuMkMF4GNHckTxaYp0Jk3hTOW2vhAAXuXNGFf_U21QXaXQmZ18YDfK2RYd0/s2560/1000000626.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8eddf80-b8a9-4b0e-9214-3d1bae1f4e10_640x266.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8eddf80-b8a9-4b0e-9214-3d1bae1f4e10_640x266.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8eddf80-b8a9-4b0e-9214-3d1bae1f4e10_640x266.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8eddf80-b8a9-4b0e-9214-3d1bae1f4e10_640x266.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/https3a2f2fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2fpublic2fimages2fb8eddf80-b.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"266\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"[substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/im...](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b8eddf80-b8a9-4b0e-9214-3d1bae1f4e10_640x266.png)\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":266,\"width\":640,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":null,\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2LEX5u3oxExBJY1M7YSUp5yH5PCnLOvMLCEaS6Nnz_wWQnbokd4J0c9MsTfpT6SKOQ4cfrOLpznCg_qCVOO181UxoATGPWQ34r1tMZiuJbIXAql5xgHcwkvrCu_Lg9octvsuMkMF4GNHckTxaYp0Jk3hTOW2vhAAXuXNGFf_U21QXaXQmZ18YDfK2RYd0/s2560/1000000626.png\",\"belowTheFold\":false,\"topImage\":true,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8eddf80-b8a9-4b0e-9214-3d1bae1f4e10_640x266.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8eddf80-b8a9-4b0e-9214-3d1bae1f4e10_640x266.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8eddf80-b8a9-4b0e-9214-3d1bae1f4e10_640x266.png 1272w, https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/202300/2025/https3a2f2fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2fpublic2fimages2fb8eddf80-b.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></picture><div></div></div></a>\n",
